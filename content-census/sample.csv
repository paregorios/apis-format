"ab","text","(Lines 29 ff.) [You must inspect] � and the water-conduits which run through the fields and from which the peasants are accustomed to lead water on the land cultivated by each of them, and see whether the water-intakes into them have the prescribed depth and whether there is sufficient room in them; and similarly the said cuttings from which the intakes pass into the above-mentioned conduit, whether they have been made strong and the entries into them from the river are thoroughly cleaned and whether in general they are in a sound state. In your tours of inspection try in going from place to place to cheer everybody up and to put them in better heart; and not only should you do this by words but also, if any of them complain of the village scribes or the komarchs about any matter touching agricultural work, you should make inquiry and put a stop to such doings as far as possible. When the sowing has been completed it would be no bad thing if you were to make a careful round of inspection; for thus you will get an accurate view of the sprouting of the crops and will easily notice the lands which are badly sown or are not sown at all, and you will thus know those who have neglected their duty and will become aware if any have used the seed for other purposes. You must regard it as one of your most indispensable duties to see that the nome be sown with the kinds of crops described by the sowing-schedule. And if there be any who are hard pressed by their rents of are completely exhausted you must not leave it unexamined. Make a list of the cattle employed in cultivation, both the royal and the private, and take the utmost possible care that the progeny of the royal cattle, when old enough to eat hay, be consigned to the calf-byres. Take care that the grain in the nomes, with the exception of that expended on the spot for seed and of that which cannot be transported by water, be brought down � It will thus be easy to load the grain on the first ships presenting themselves; and devote yourself to such business in no cursory fashion � Take care also that the prescribed supplies of grain, of which I send you a list, are brought down to Alexandria punctually, not only correct in amount but also tested and fit for use. Visit also the weaving-houses in which the linen is woven, and do your utmost to have the largest possible number of looms in operation, the weavers supplying the full amount of embroidered stuffs prescribed for the nome. If any of them are in arrears with the pieces ordered, let the prices fixed by the ordinance for each kind be exacted from them. Take especial care, too, that the linen is good and has the prescribed number of weft-threads �. Visit also the washing-houses where the flax is washed and make a list, and report so that there may be a supply of kastor-oil and natron for washing. [Book?] always the monthly quantity of pieces of linen in the actual month and the quantity of the next month in the next, in order that the corresponding amounts may be apportioned (?) to the accounts of the treasury and the contractors. If there is any surplus over what is booked in the first month, let the surplus be booked in the next month as part of the monthly quantity. Let all the looms which are idle be transported to the metropolis of the nome, deposited in the store-house, and sealed up. Audit the revenue accounts, if possible, village by village--and we think it not to be impossible, if you devote yourself zealously to the business--, if not, by toparchies, passing in the audit nothing but payments to the bank in the case of money taxes, and in the case of grain dues or oil-bearing produce, only deliveries to the sitologoi. If there be any deficit in these, compel the toparchai and the tax-farmers to pay into the banks, for the arrears in grain the values assigned in the ordinance, for those in oil-bearing produce according to the liquid product for each kind. It behoves you to bestow care on all the points mentioned in the memorandum, but primarily those which refer to the oil-factories. For if you duly give heed to them you will increase not a little the sale in the nome, and the thefts will be stopped. This you would achieve by scrutinizing on each occasion the local factories and the store-houses for the produce both dry and liquid, and by sealing them. Be sure that the amounts delivered to the oil-makers do not exceed what is about to be used in the presses which exist in the factories. Take pains to let all the oil-presses be in operation if possible; or if not, most of them, and keep a close watch as you can on the rest �. The supernumerary implements of those presses which are not in operation must be collected and sealed up in the store-houses. If you are neglectful (?) in this � be sure that besides the payments � you will fall into no ordinary contempt, which you will not be able easily to remove. If you neglect your duty as regards this, [your honor will in no way increase.] Since the revenue from the pasturage dues, too, is one of the most important, it will most readily be increased if you carry out the registration (of cattle) in the best possible way. The most favorable season for one so engaged is about the month of Mesore; for the whole country in this month being covered with water, it happens that cattle-breeders send their flocks to the highest places, being unable to scatter them on other places. See to it, too, that the goods for sale be not sold at prices higher than those prescribed. Make also a careful investigation of those goods which have no fixed prices and on which the dealers may put what prices they like; and after having put a fair surplus on the wares being sold, make the � dispose of them. Take care to inspect the calf-byres also, and do your best to ensure that the grain be supplied in them till the time of the green food, and the quantity prescribed daily be used for the calves, and that the � be delivered regularly in full, both that from the locality and, if they need in addition an imported supply, from the other villages as well. Take care also that of the local trees the planting of the mature ones be done at the right season, namely for willows and mulberry-trees, and that of acacia-trees and tamarisk about the month of Choiak. Of these the rest must be planted on the royal embankments, but the young ones must be planted in beds in order to have all possible attention during the time of watering, and when it is the proper time for planting, then let them � set them on the royal embankments. The guarding of them must be done by the contractors in order that the plants suffer no damage from sheep or any other cause. In your further tours of inspection notice also whether any cut trees are left on the embankments or in the fields and make a list of them. Make also a list of the royal houses and the gardens belonging to them, stating what attention each one of these requires, and report to us. Take care, too, that the matter of the native soldiers be arranged according to the memorandum which we compiled on the men who absconded from their work and the � sailors, in order that � (all?) those men who fall into your hands may be kept together until they are sent to Alexandria. Take particular care that no peculation or any other wrong take place. For every one resident in the country must clearly understand and believe that all acts of this kind have been stopped and that they are freed from the bad conditions of the past, no one having the right to do what he likes, but everything being managed in the best way; you will (thus) make the countryside secure and [will increase] the revenue in no small measure. Now to comprise everything and to deliver it to you in memoranda is not easy, owing to the variety of circumstances in consequence of the present situation. Be careful to see that nothing of what I have ordered in my memorandum is neglected, so far as possible, and likewise inform me concerning contingencies, in order that � For since all our business is necessarily conducted by correspondence � you should arrange for them to write about each of the injunctions sent, if possible �, otherwise certifying the reasons, in order that � and that nothing of what has been specified be neglected � If you act thus, you will fulfill your official duty and your own safety will be assured. But enough now on this subject. I thought it well to write down for you in this memorandum what I told you in sending you to the nome. I considered that your prime duty is to act with peculiar care, honestly, and in the best possible way�; and your next duty is to behave well and be upright in your district, to keep clear of bad company, to avoid all base collusion, to believe that, if you are without reproach in this, you will be held deserving for higher functions, to keep the instructions in your hand, and to report on everything as has been ordered.","part","N"

"ab","text","(Lines 29 ff.) [You must inspect] � and the water-conduits which run through the fields and from which the peasants are accustomed to lead water on the land cultivated by each of them, and see whether the water-intakes into them have the prescribed depth and whether there is sufficient room in them; and similarly the said cuttings from which the intakes pass into the above-mentioned conduit, whether they have been made strong and the entries into them from the river are thoroughly cleaned and whether in general they are in a sound state. In your tours of inspection try in going from place to place to cheer everybody up and to put them in better heart; and not only should you do this by words but also, if any of them complain of the village scribes or the komarchs about any matter touching agricultural work, you should make inquiry and put a stop to such doings as far as possible. When the sowing has been completed it would be no bad thing if you were to make a careful round of inspection; for thus you will get an accurate view of the sprouting of the crops and will easily notice the lands which are badly sown or are not sown at all, and you will thus know those who have neglected their duty and will become aware if any have used the seed for other purposes. You must regard it as one of your most indispensable duties to see that the nome be sown with the kinds of crops described by the sowing-schedule. And if there be any who are hard pressed by their rents of are completely exhausted you must not leave it unexamined. Make a list of the cattle employed in cultivation, both the royal and the private, and take the utmost possible care that the progeny of the royal cattle, when old enough to eat hay, be consigned to the calf-byres. Take care that the grain in the nomes, with the exception of that expended on the spot for seed and of that which cannot be transported by water, be brought down � It will thus be easy to load the grain on the first ships presenting themselves; and devote yourself to such business in no cursory fashion � Take care also that the prescribed supplies of grain, of which I send you a list, are brought down to Alexandria punctually, not only correct in amount but also tested and fit for use. Visit also the weaving-houses in which the linen is woven, and do your utmost to have the largest possible number of looms in operation, the weavers supplying the full amount of embroidered stuffs prescribed for the nome. If any of them are in arrears with the pieces ordered, let the prices fixed by the ordinance for each kind be exacted from them. Take especial care, too, that the linen is good and has the prescribed number of weft-threads �. Visit also the washing-houses where the flax is washed and make a list, and report so that there may be a supply of kastor-oil and natron for washing. [Book?] always the monthly quantity of pieces of linen in the actual month and the quantity of the next month in the next, in order that the corresponding amounts may be apportioned (?) to the accounts of the treasury and the contractors. If there is any surplus over what is booked in the first month, let the surplus be booked in the next month as part of the monthly quantity. Let all the looms which are idle be transported to the metropolis of the nome, deposited in the store-house, and sealed up. Audit the revenue accounts, if possible, village by village--and we think it not to be impossible, if you devote yourself zealously to the business--, if not, by toparchies, passing in the audit nothing but payments to the bank in the case of money taxes, and in the case of grain dues or oil-bearing produce, only deliveries to the sitologoi. If there be any deficit in these, compel the toparchai and the tax-farmers to pay into the banks, for the arrears in grain the values assigned in the ordinance, for those in oil-bearing produce according to the liquid product for each kind. It behoves you to bestow care on all the points mentioned in the memorandum, but primarily those which refer to the oil-factories. For if you duly give heed to them you will increase not a little the sale in the nome, and the thefts will be stopped. This you would achieve by scrutinizing on each occasion the local factories and the store-houses for the produce both dry and liquid, and by sealing them. Be sure that the amounts delivered to the oil-makers do not exceed what is about to be used in the presses which exist in the factories. Take pains to let all the oil-presses be in operation if possible; or if not, most of them, and keep a close watch as you can on the rest �. The supernumerary implements of those presses which are not in operation must be collected and sealed up in the store-houses. If you are neglectful (?) in this � be sure that besides the payments � you will fall into no ordinary contempt, which you will not be able easily to remove. If you neglect your duty as regards this, [your honor will in no way increase.] Since the revenue from the pasturage dues, too, is one of the most important, it will most readily be increased if you carry out the registration (of cattle) in the best possible way. The most favorable season for one so engaged is about the month of Mesore; for the whole country in this month being covered with water, it happens that cattle-breeders send their flocks to the highest places, being unable to scatter them on other places. See to it, too, that the goods for sale be not sold at prices higher than those prescribed. Make also a careful investigation of those goods which have no fixed prices and on which the dealers may put what prices they like; and after having put a fair surplus on the wares being sold, make the � dispose of them. Take care to inspect the calf-byres also, and do your best to ensure that the grain be supplied in them till the time of the green food, and the quantity prescribed daily be used for the calves, and that the � be delivered regularly in full, both that from the locality and, if they need in addition an imported supply, from the other villages as well. Take care also that of the local trees the planting of the mature ones be done at the right season, namely for willows and mulberry-trees, and that of acacia-trees and tamarisk about the month of Choiak. Of these the rest must be planted on the royal embankments, but the young ones must be planted in beds in order to have all possible attention during the time of watering, and when it is the proper time for planting, then let them � set them on the royal embankments. The guarding of them must be done by the contractors in order that the plants suffer no damage from sheep or any other cause. In your further tours of inspection notice also whether any cut trees are left on the embankments or in the fields and make a list of them. Make also a list of the royal houses and the gardens belonging to them, stating what attention each one of these requires, and report to us. Take care, too, that the matter of the native soldiers be arranged according to the memorandum which we compiled on the men who absconded from their work and the � sailors, in order that � (all?) those men who fall into your hands may be kept together until they are sent to Alexandria. Take particular care that no peculation or any other wrong take place. For every one resident in the country must clearly understand and believe that all acts of this kind have been stopped and that they are freed from the bad conditions of the past, no one having the right to do what he likes, but everything being managed in the best way; you will (thus) make the countryside secure and [will increase] the revenue in no small measure. Now to comprise everything and to deliver it to you in memoranda is not easy, owing to the variety of circumstances in consequence of the present situation. Be careful to see that nothing of what I have ordered in my memorandum is neglected, so far as possible, and likewise inform me concerning contingencies, in order that � For since all our business is necessarily conducted by correspondence � you should arrange for them to write about each of the injunctions sent, if possible �, otherwise certifying the reasons, in order that � and that nothing of what has been specified be neglected � If you act thus, you will fulfill your official duty and your own safety will be assured.

"ab","text","(Lines 29 ff.) [You must inspect] � and the water-conduits which run through the fields and from which the peasants are accustomed to lead water on the land cultivated by each of them, and see whether the water-intakes into them have the prescribed depth and whether there is sufficient room in them; and similarly the said cuttings from which the intakes pass into the above-mentioned conduit, whether they have been made strong and the entries into them from the river are thoroughly cleaned and whether in general they are in a sound state. In your tours of inspection try in going from place to place to cheer everybody up and to put them in better heart; and not only should you do this by words but also, if any of them complain of the village scribes or the komarchs about any matter touching agricultural work, you should make inquiry and put a stop to such doings as far as possible. When the sowing has been completed it would be no bad thing if you were to make a careful round of inspection; for thus you will get an accurate view of the sprouting of the crops and will easily notice the lands which are badly sown or are not sown at all, and you will thus know those who have neglected their duty and will become aware if any have used the seed for other purposes. You must regard it as one of your most indispensable duties to see that the nome be sown with the kinds of crops described by the sowing-schedule. And if there be any who are hard pressed by their rents of are completely exhausted you must not leave it unexamined. Make a list of the cattle employed in cultivation, both the royal and the private, and take the utmost possible care that the progeny of the royal cattle, when old enough to eat hay, be consigned to the calf-byres. Take care that the grain in the nomes, with the exception of that expended on the spot for seed and of that which cannot be transported by water, be brought down � It will thus be easy to load the grain on the first ships presenting themselves; and devote yourself to such business in no cursory fashion � Take care also that the prescribed supplies of grain, of which I send you a list, are brought down to Alexandria punctually, not only correct in amount but also tested and fit for use. Visit also the weaving-houses in which the linen is woven, and do your utmost to have the largest possible number of looms in operation, the weavers supplying the full amount of embroidered stuffs prescribed for the nome. If any of them are in arrears with the pieces ordered, let the prices fixed by the ordinance for each kind be exacted from them. Take especial care, too, that the linen is good and has the prescribed number of weft-threads �. Visit also the washing-houses where the flax is washed and make a list, and report so that there may be a supply of kastor-oil and natron for washing. [Book?] always the monthly quantity of pieces of linen in the actual month and the quantity of the next month in the next, in order that the corresponding amounts may be apportioned (?) to the accounts of the treasury and the contractors. If there is any surplus over what is booked in the first month, let the surplus be booked in the next month as part of the monthly quantity. Let all the looms which are idle be transported to the metropolis of the nome, deposited in the store-house, and sealed up. Audit the revenue accounts, if possible, village by village--and we think it not to be impossible, if you devote yourself zealously to the business--, if not, by toparchies, passing in the audit nothing but payments to the bank in the case of money taxes, and in the case of grain dues or oil-bearing produce, only deliveries to the sitologoi. If there be any deficit in these, compel the toparchai and the tax-farmers to pay into the banks, for the arrears in grain the values assigned in the ordinance, for those in oil-bearing produce according to the liquid product for each kind. It behoves you to bestow care on all the points mentioned in the memorandum, but primarily those which refer to the oil-factories. For if you duly give heed to them you will increase not a little the sale in the nome, and the thefts will be stopped. This you would achieve by scrutinizing on each occasion the local factories and the store-houses for the produce both dry and liquid, and by sealing them. Be sure that the amounts delivered to the oil-makers do not exceed what is about to be used in the presses which exist in the factories. Take pains to let all the oil-presses be in operation if possible; or if not, most of them, and keep a close watch as you can on the rest �. The supernumerary implements of those presses which are not in operation must be collected and sealed up in the store-houses. If you are neglectful (?) in this � be sure that besides the payments � you will fall into no ordinary contempt, which you will not be able easily to remove. If you neglect your duty as regards this, [your honor will in no way increase.] Since the revenue from the pasturage dues, too, is one of the most important, it will most readily be increased if you carry out the registration (of cattle) in the best possible way. The most favorable season for one so engaged is about the month of Mesore; for the whole country in this month being covered with water, it happens that cattle-breeders send their flocks to the highest places, being unable to scatter them on other places. See to it, too, that the goods for sale be not sold at prices higher than those prescribed. Make also a careful investigation of those goods which have no fixed prices and on which the dealers may put what prices they like; and after having put a fair surplus on the wares being sold, make the � dispose of them. Take care to inspect the calf-byres also, and do your best to ensure that the grain be supplied in them till the time of the green food, and the quantity prescribed daily be used for the calves, and that the � be delivered regularly in full, both that from the locality and, if they need in addition an imported supply, from the other villages as well. Take care also that of the local trees the planting of the mature ones be done at the right season, namely for willows and mulberry-trees, and that of acacia-trees and tamarisk about the month of Choiak. Of these the rest must be planted on the royal embankments, but the young ones must be planted in beds in order to have all possible attention during the time of watering, and when it is the proper time for planting, then let them � set them on the royal embankments. The guarding of them must be done by the contractors in order that the plants suffer no damage from sheep or any other cause. In your further tours of inspection notice also whether any cut trees are left on the embankments or in the fields and make a list of them. Make also a list of the royal houses and the gardens belonging to them, stating what attention each one of these requires, and report to us. Take care, too, that the matter of the native soldiers be arranged according to the memorandum which we compiled on the men who absconded from their work and the � sailors, in order that � (all?) those men who fall into your hands may be kept together until they are sent to Alexandria. Take particular care that no peculation or any other wrong take place. For every one resident in the country must clearly understand and believe that all acts of this kind have been stopped and that they are freed from the bad conditions of the past, no one having the right to do what he likes, but everything being managed in the best way; you will (thus) make the countryside secure and [will increase] the revenue in no small measure. Now to comprise everything and to deliver it to you in memoranda is not easy, owing to the variety of circumstances in consequence of the present situation. Be careful to see that nothing of what I have ordered in my memorandum is neglected, so far as possible, and likewise inform me concerning contingencies, in order that � For since all our business is necessarily conducted by correspondence � you should arrange for them to write about each of the injunctions sent, if possible �, otherwise certifying the reasons, in order that � and that nothing of what has been specified be neglected � If you act thus, you will fulfill your official duty and your own safety will be assured. But enough now on this subject. I thought it well to write down for you in this memorandum what I told you in sending you to the nome. I considered that your prime duty is to act with peculiar care, honestly, and in the best possible way�; and your next duty is to behave well and be upright in your district, to keep clear of bad company, to avoid all base collusion, to believe that, if you are without reproach in this, you will be held deserving for higher functions, to keep the instructions in your hand, and to report on everything as has been ordered.","part","N"

[You must inspect] � and the water-conduits which run through the fields and from which the peasants are accustomed to lead water on the land cultivated by each of them, and see whether the water-intakes into them have the prescribed depth and whether there is sufficient room in them; and similarly the said cuttings from which the intakes pass into the above-mentioned conduit, whether they have been made strong and the entries into them from the river are thoroughly cleaned and whether in general they are in a sound state. In your tours of inspection try in going from place to place to cheer everybody up and to put them in better heart; and not only should you do this by words but also, if any of them complain of the village scribes or the komarchs about any matter touching agricultural work, you should make inquiry and put a stop to such doings as far as possible. When the sowing has been completed it would be no bad thing if you were to make a careful round of inspection; for thus you will get an accurate view of the sprouting of the crops and will easily notice the lands which are badly sown or are not sown at all, and you will thus know those who have neglected their duty and will become aware if any have used the seed for other purposes. You must regard it as one of your most indispensable duties to see that the nome be sown with the kinds of crops described by the sowing-schedule. And if there be any who are hard pressed by their rents of are completely exhausted you must not leave it unexamined. Make a list of the cattle employed in cultivation, both the royal and the private, and take the utmost possible care that the progeny of the royal cattle, when old enough to eat hay, be consigned to the calf-byres. Take care that the grain in the nomes, with the exception of that expended on the spot for seed and of that which cannot be transported by water, be brought down � It will thus be easy to load the grain on the first ships presenting themselves; and devote yourself to such business in no cursory fashion � Take care also that the prescribed supplies of grain, of which I send you a list, are brought down to Alexandria punctually, not only correct in amount but also tested and fit for use. Visit also the weaving-houses in which the linen is woven, and do your utmost to have the largest possible number of looms in operation, the weavers supplying the full amount of embroidered stuffs prescribed for the nome. If any of them are in arrears with the pieces ordered, let the prices fixed by the ordinance for each kind be exacted from them. Take especial care, too, that the linen is good and has the prescribed number of weft-threads �. Visit also the washing-houses where the flax is washed and make a list, and report so that there may be a supply of kastor-oil and natron for washing. [Book?] always the monthly quantity of pieces of linen in the actual month and the quantity of the next month in the next, in order that the corresponding amounts may be apportioned (?) to the accounts of the treasury and the contractors. If there is any surplus over what is booked in the first month, let the surplus be booked in the next month as part of the monthly quantity. Let all the looms which are idle be transported to the metropolis of the nome, deposited in the store-house, and sealed up. Audit the revenue accounts, if possible, village by village--and we think it not to be impossible, if you devote yourself zealously to the business--, if not, by toparchies, passing in the audit nothing but payments to the bank in the case of money taxes, and in the case of grain dues or oil-bearing produce, only deliveries to the sitologoi. If there be any deficit in these, compel the toparchai and the tax-farmers to pay into the banks, for the arrears in grain the values assigned in the ordinance, for those in oil-bearing produce according to the liquid product for each kind. It behoves you to bestow care on all the points mentioned in the memorandum, but primarily those which refer to the oil-factories. For if you duly give heed to them you will increase not a little the sale in the nome, and the thefts will be stopped. This you would achieve by scrutinizing on each occasion the local factories and the store-houses for the produce both dry and liquid, and by sealing them. Be sure that the amounts delivered to the oil-makers do not exceed what is about to be used in the presses which exist in the factories. Take pains to let all the oil-presses be in operation if possible; or if not, most of them, and keep a close watch as you can on the rest �. The supernumerary implements of those presses which are not in operation must be collected and sealed up in the store-houses. If you are neglectful (?) in this � be sure that besides the payments � you will fall into no ordinary contempt, which you will not be able easily to remove. If you neglect your duty as regards this, [your honor will in no way increase.] Since the revenue from the pasturage dues, too, is one of the most important, it will most readily be increased if you carry out the registration (of cattle) in the best possible way. The most favorable season for one so engaged is about the month of Mesore; for the whole country in this month being covered with water, it happens that cattle-breeders send their flocks to the highest places, being unable to scatter them on other places. See to it, too, that the goods for sale be not sold at prices higher than those prescribed. Make also a careful investigation of those goods which have no fixed prices and on which the dealers may put what prices they like; and after having put a fair surplus on the wares being sold, make the � dispose of them. Take care to inspect the calf-byres also, and do your best to ensure that the grain be supplied in them till the time of the green food, and the quantity prescribed daily be used for the calves, and that the � be delivered regularly in full, both that from the locality and, if they need in addition an imported supply, from the other villages as well. Take care also that of the local trees the planting of the mature ones be done at the right season, namely for willows and mulberry-trees, and that of acacia-trees and tamarisk about the month of Choiak. Of these the rest must be planted on the royal embankments, but the young ones must be planted in beds in order to have all possible attention during the time of watering, and when it is the proper time for planting, then let them � set them on the royal embankments. The guarding of them must be done by the contractors in order that the plants suffer no damage from sheep or any other cause. In your further tours of inspection notice also whether any cut trees are left on the embankments or in the fields and make a list of them. Make also a list of the royal houses and the gardens belonging to them, stating what attention each one of these requires, and report to us. Take care, too, that the matter of the native soldiers be arranged according to the memorandum which we compiled on the men who absconded from their work and the � sailors, in order that � (all?) those men who fall into your hands may be kept together until they are sent to Alexandria. Take particular care that no peculation or any other wrong take place. For every one resident in the country must clearly understand and believe that all acts of this kind have been stopped and that they are freed from the bad conditions of the past, no one having the right to do what he likes, but everything being managed in the best way; you will (thus) make the countryside secure and [will increase] the revenue in no small measure. Now to comprise everything and to deliver it to you in memoranda is not easy, owing to the variety of circumstances in consequence of the present situation. Be careful to see that nothing of what I have ordered in my memorandum is neglected, so far as possible, and likewise inform me concerning contingencies, in order that � For since all our business is necessarily conducted by correspondence � you should arrange for them to write about each of the injunctions sent, if possible �, otherwise certifying the reasons, in order that � and that nothing of what has been specified be neglected � If you act thus, you will fulfill your official duty and your own safety will be assured. But enough now on this subject. I thought it well to write down for you in this memorandum what I told you in sending you to the nome. I considered that your prime duty is to act with peculiar care, honestly, and in the best possible way�; and your next duty is to behave well and be upright in your district, to keep clear of bad company, to avoid all base collusion, to believe that, if you are without reproach in this, you will be held deserving for higher functions, to keep the instructions in your hand, and to report on everything as has been ordered.","part","N"

"ab","text","(lines 1-13) King Ptolemaios and Queen Kleopatra the sister and Queen Kleopatra the wife proclaim an amnesty to all their subjects for errors, crimes, accusations, condemnations and charges of all kinds up to the 9th of Pharmouthi of the 52nd year, except to persons guilty of wilful murder or sacrilege. And they have decreed that persons who have gone into hiding because they were guilty of theft or subject to other charges shall return to their own homes and resume their former occupations, and their remaining property shall not be sold... And they remit to all persons the arrears up to the same period in respect of both rents in grain and money taxes, except to hereditary lessees who have given a surety. (�) (lines 22-35) And they have decreed that the (officials of the custom-house) shall not � nor seize goods unless they find upon the wharf at the harbours of Alexandria something on which duty has not been paid or of which the importation is forbidden; these they are to bring to the dioiketes. Likewise persons who travel on foot up the country from Alexandria by the land-route which leads � and persons crossing from one tongue of land to another shall have no payment of any kind demanded or exacted from them except the legal duties. Likewise in the case of persons importing goods through the foreign mart � the seizure is to be made at the custom-house itself. (lines 36-64) And they have decreed that all recipients of grants of land and all holders of temple or other land en aphesei, both those who have encroached on the crown land and all others who hold more land than that to which they are entitled, shall, on giving up (?) the excess and declaring themselves and paying a year's rent, be released from payments due from them up to the 51st year, and the legal tenure of their holdings is guaranteed to them. And that the picked forces, and the native soldiers who own ten or seven arouras, and their leaders, and all others placed in that class, and the native marines, and those who � , shall have the legal ownership of the lands which they have possessed up to the � year, and shall not be subject ot accusation of interference. And they remit to every one the arrears of the work-tax. (Lines 50-72) And they have decreed that the temple land and other sacred revenues which belong to the temples shall remain assured to them, and that the temples shall receive the tithes which they used to receive from holding and gardens and other land. And in like manner the appointed sums or what they received from the treasury for the pay of the temples and the other sums granted to them up to the 51st year shall be paid to them regularly, as in the case of their other revenues (?), and no one shall be allowed to take anything from these sources of income. No one shall take away by force anything of what has been dedicated to the gods, nor apply forcible persuasion to the superintendents of the sacred revenue, whether derived from villages or land or other temple revenues, nor shall the tax on associations or the crown-tax or the artaba-tax be paid upon what has been dedicated to the gods, nor shall the temple lands be worked on any pretext, but they shall be left to be administered by the priests. And they remit to the overseers of the temples and the chief priests and priests the arrears on account of both the tax for overseers and the values of woven cloths up to the 50th year. Likewise they remit to holders of honorable offices, or of posts as prophet or scribe, or of other saced offices in the temples, the arrears owed in the temples for the emoluments demanded on certain occasions up to the 50th year. Likewise they remit the penalties incurred by those who have extorted more (than their due) emoluments up to the same period. Likewise to holders of such offices in the lesser temples, both shrines of Isis and feeding places of ibises and hawk-shrines and Anubis-shrines and the like, they remit the corresponding arrears and penalties up to the same period. (�) (Lines 77-82) And they have decreed that the expenses for the burial of Apis and Mnevis should be demanded from the crown revenues, as in the case of the deified personages. Likewise in the case of the other sacred animals the sums required (shall be paid by the crown). (Likewise) those honorable offices and posts as prophet or scribe which have been bought for the temples out of the temple revenus, and of which the prices have been paid, shall remain assured to the temples, but the priests are not permitted to make over these offices to other persons. (Lines 83-84) And they have decreed that no one is to be dragged away of forcibly ejected from the existing places of asylum. (Lines 85-92) And since it sometimes happens that the sitologoi and antigrapheis use larger measures than the correct bronze measures appointed in each nome � in estimating dues to the state, and in consequence the cultivators are made to pay (more than the proper number of choinikes?), they have decreed that the strategoi and the overseers of the revenues and the basilikoi grammateis shall test the measures in the most thorough manner possible in the presence of those concerned in the revenues of � and the priests and the cleruchs and other owners of land en aphesei �, and the measures must not exceed (the government measure) by more than the two � allowed for errors. Those who disobey this decree are punishable with death. (Lines 93-98) And they have decreed that the cultivators of vine-land or gardens throughout the country, if they plant them between the 53rd and 57th years in the land which has become flooded or dry, shall be left untaxed for five years dating from the time at which they plant them, and from the sixth year for three years more they shall be required to pay less than the proper amount, payment being made in the fourth year, but from the ninth year onwards they shall pay the same as the other owners of land in good condition; and that cultivators in the country belonging to Alexandria shall be allowed an extra three years' grace. (Lines 99-101) And they have decreed that those who have bought from the cron houses of vineyards or gardens of other (holdings?) or boats or anything else whatever, shall remain in undisturbed possession, and they shall not have persons quartered in their houses. (�) (Lines 134-146 = 147-167) And they have decreed that owners of houses which have been pulled down or burnt shall be permitted to rebuild them according to the prescribed measurements. And that persons who own private houses in the village shall likewise be allowed to build up their homes to the height of �, and rebuild the temples to the height of 10 cubits, except the inhabitants of Panopolis. No one is to collect anything whatever from the cultivators and the tax-payers and the persons connected with the revenues and the honey-workers and the rest for the benefit of the strategoi or chiefs of the guards or archiphylakitai or oikonomoi or their agents or the other officials. Neither strategoi nor holders of official positions nor their subordinates nor any other persons whatever shall take the richest Crown land from the cultivators by fraud or cultivate it at choice. [lines 147-167 repeat lines 134-146] (Lines 168-177) The following classes, the Greeks serving in the army, the priests, the cultivators of Crown lands, the �, all the wool-weavers and clothmakers, the swineherds, the gooseherds, and makers of �, oil, castor-oil, honey, and beer, who pay the proper sums to the Crown, shall not have persons quartered in the one house in which each of them lives, and in the case of their other buildings which may be used for quarters, not more than half shall be occupied for that purpose. (lines 178-187) And they have decreed that the strategoi and the other officials may not compel any of the inhabitants of the country to work for their private service, nor use their cattle for any purpose of their own, nor force them to feed calves and other animals for sacrifice, nor force them to provide geese or birds or wine or grain at a price or on the occasion of renewals, nor oblige them to work without payment on any pretext whatever. (Lines 188-192) And they remit to the guards throughout the country the penalties incurred by making false returns in connection with the government inspections and the produce which they have lost; and they remit the sums which have been paid them for arrears or for other reasons but which have disappeared, up to the 50th year. (Lines 193-206) And (they have decreed) that those who have failed to deliver to the Crown at a price the oil-yielding produce from cleruchic or temple or other land up to the same period, and those who have failed to supply transport for the assembly are released from the penalties which they have incurred. Likewise that persons who have failed to provide reeds and light material for the embankments (are released from the penalties which they have incurred). Likewise the cultivators of Crown lands, the priests and other owners of land in release, who have failed to plant the proper number of arouras up to the 51st year, are released from the penalties which they have incurred, but the planting (of the proper number) shall be made from the 52nd year onwards. And they remit the penalties incurred by those who have cut down wood on their own property in contravention of the published decrees. (lines 207-220) And they have decreed in cases of Egyptians who bring actions against Greeks and in case of Greeks who bring actions against Egyptians, or of Egyptians against Egyptians, with regard to all classes except the cultivators of Crown land and the tax-payers and all others connected with the revenues, that where Egyptians make an agreement with Greeks by contracts written in Greek they shall give and receive satisfaction before the chrematistai; but where Greeks make agreements by contracts written in Egyptian they shall give satisfaction before the native judges in accordance with the national laws; and that suits of Egyptians against Egyptians shall not be dragged by the chrematistai into their own courts, but they shall allow them to be decided before the native judges in accordance with the national laws. (Lines 221-247) And they have decreed that collectors of foreign debts must not on any pretext whatever get control over the persons of the cultivators of Crown land or the tax-payers or the others whom the previously issued decrees forbid to be brought up for accusation; but the executions in cases which come before the collectors shall be levied upon the rest of the debtor's property which is not exempted by the following decree. And they have decreed that in the case of cultivators of Crown land the collectors shall not sell up one house containing their working implements, or their cattle or other equipment necessary for cultivation, nor shall they apply the working implements to working temple land or any other on any pretext whatever. And in the same way they shall not sell the cloth-waeving tools of the cloth-weavers and the byssus-makers and the wool-weavers and all persons engaged in similar trades on any pretext whatever; nor shall any other persons take possession of or use the tools required for cloth-weaving or byssus-manufacture than the tax-payers themselves and the byssus-workers, who alone shall use them in the temples themselves for the service of the sovereigns and the vestments of the other gods. (Lines 248-251) And (they have decreed) that no one holding an official position or any one else shall impose labor upon the cloth-weavers and byssus-workers and robe-weavers gratis or at reduced wages. (Lines 252-264) And they have decreed that no one may appropriate boats for his own use on any pretext whatever. And that neither the strategoi nor any others who are in charge of the Crown, State or sacred interests may arrest any one for a private debt or offence or owing to a private quarrel and keep him imprisoned in their houses or anywhere else on any pretext whatever; but if they accuse any one, they shall bring him before the magistrates appointed in each nome, and shall receive or give satisfaction in accordance with the decrees and regulations.","part","N"

"ab","text","(lines 1-13) King Ptolemaios and Queen Kleopatra the sister and Queen Kleopatra the wife proclaim an amnesty to all their subjects for errors, crimes, accusations, condemnations and charges of all kinds up to the 9th of Pharmouthi of the 52nd year, except to persons guilty of wilful murder or sacrilege. And they have decreed that persons who have gone into hiding because they were guilty of theft or subject to other charges shall return to their own homes and resume their former occupations, and their remaining property shall not be sold... And they remit to all persons the arrears up to the same period in respect of both rents in grain and money taxes, except to hereditary lessees who have given a surety. (�) (lines 22-35) And they have decreed that the (officials of the custom-house) shall not � nor seize goods unless they find upon the wharf at the harbours of Alexandria something on which duty has not been paid or of which the importation is forbidden; these they are to bring to the dioiketes. Likewise persons who travel on foot up the country from Alexandria by the land-route which leads � and persons crossing from one tongue of land to another shall have no payment of any kind demanded or exacted from them except the legal duties. Likewise in the case of persons importing goods through the foreign mart � the seizure is to be made at the custom-house itself.

Likewise the cultivators of Crown lands, the priests and other owners of land in release, who have failed to plant the proper number of arouras up to the 51st year, are released from the penalties which they have incurred, but the planting (of the proper number) shall be made from the 52nd year onwards. And they remit the penalties incurred by those who have cut down wood on their own property in contravention of the published decrees. (lines 207-220) And they have decreed in cases of Egyptians who bring actions against Greeks and in case of Greeks who bring actions against Egyptians, or of Egyptians against Egyptians, with regard to all classes except the cultivators of Crown land and the tax-payers and all others connected with the revenues, that where Egyptians make an agreement with Greeks by contracts written in Greek they shall give and receive satisfaction before the chrematistai; but where Greeks make agreements by contracts written in Egyptian they shall give satisfaction before the native judges in accordance with the national laws; and that suits of Egyptians against Egyptians shall not be dragged by the chrematistai into their own courts, but they shall allow them to be decided before the native judges in accordance with the national laws.

(Lines 248-251) And (they have decreed) that no one holding an official position or any one else shall impose labor upon the cloth-weavers and byssus-workers and robe-weavers gratis or at reduced wages.

And they have decreed that persons who have gone into hiding because they were guilty of theft or subject to other charges shall return to their own homes and resume their former occupations, and their remaining property shall not be sold... And they remit to all persons the arrears up to the same period in respect of both rents in grain and money taxes, except to hereditary lessees who have given a surety. (�) (lines 22-35) And they have decreed that the (officials of the custom-house) shall not � nor seize goods unless they find upon the wharf at the harbours of Alexandria something on which duty has not been paid or of which the importation is forbidden; these they are to bring to the dioiketes. Likewise persons who travel on foot up the country from Alexandria by the land-route which leads � and persons crossing from one tongue of land to another shall have no payment of any kind demanded or exacted from them except the legal duties. Likewise in the case of persons importing goods through the foreign mart � the seizure is to be made at the custom-house itself. (lines 36-64) And they have decreed that all recipients of grants of land and all holders of temple or other land en aphesei, both those who have encroached on the crown land and all others who hold more land than that to which they are entitled, shall, on giving up (?) the excess and declaring themselves and paying a year's rent, be released from payments due from them up to the 51st year, and the legal tenure of their holdings is guaranteed to them. And that the picked forces, and the native soldiers who own ten or seven arouras, and their leaders, and all others placed in that class, and the native marines, and those who � , shall have the legal ownership of the lands which they have possessed up to the � year, and shall not be subject ot accusation of interference. And they remit to every one the arrears of the work-tax. (Lines 50-72) And they have decreed that the temple land and other sacred revenues which belong to the temples shall remain assured to them, and that the temples shall receive the tithes which they used to receive from holding and gardens and other land. And in like manner the appointed sums or what they received from the treasury for the pay of the temples and the other sums granted to them up to the 51st year shall be paid to them regularly, as in the case of their other revenues (?), and no one shall be allowed to take anything from these sources of income. No one shall take away by force anything of what has been dedicated to the gods, nor apply forcible persuasion to the superintendents of the sacred revenue, whether derived from villages or land or other temple revenues, nor shall the tax on associations or the crown-tax or the artaba-tax be paid upon what has been dedicated to the gods, nor shall the temple lands be worked on any pretext, but they shall be left to be administered by the priests.

Likewise they remit to holders of honorable offices, or of posts as prophet or scribe, or of other saced offices in the temples, the arrears owed in the temples for the emoluments demanded on certain occasions up to the 50th year. Likewise they remit the penalties incurred by those who have extorted more (than their due) emoluments up to the same period.

No one is to collect anything whatever from the cultivators and the tax-payers and the persons connected with the revenues and the honey-workers and the rest for the benefit of the strategoi or chiefs of the guards or archiphylakitai or oikonomoi or their agents or the other officials. Neither strategoi nor holders of official positions nor their subordinates nor any other persons whatever shall take the richest Crown land from the cultivators by fraud or cultivate it at choice.

(Lines 193-206) And (they have decreed) that those who have failed to deliver to the Crown at a price the oil-yielding produce from cleruchic or temple or other land up to the same period, and those who have failed to supply transport for the assembly are released from the penalties which they have incurred. Likewise that persons who have failed to provide reeds and light material for the embankments (are released from the penalties which they have incurred). Likewise the cultivators of Crown lands, the priests and other owners of land in release, who have failed to plant the proper number of arouras up to the 51st year, are released from the penalties which they have incurred, but the planting (of the proper number) shall be made from the 52nd year onwards. And they remit the penalties incurred by those who have cut down wood on their own property in contravention of the published decrees. (lines 207-220) And they have decreed in cases of Egyptians who bring actions against Greeks and in case of Greeks who bring actions against Egyptians, or of Egyptians against Egyptians, with regard to all classes except the cultivators of Crown land and the tax-payers and all others connected with the revenues, that where Egyptians make an agreement with Greeks by contracts written in Greek they shall give and receive satisfaction before the chrematistai; but where Greeks make agreements by contracts written in Egyptian they shall give satisfaction before the native judges in accordance with the national laws; and that suits of Egyptians against Egyptians shall not be dragged by the chrematistai into their own courts, but they shall allow them to be decided before the native judges in accordance with the national laws. (Lines 221-247) And they have decreed that collectors of foreign debts must not on any pretext whatever get control over the persons of the cultivators of Crown land or the tax-payers or the others whom the previously issued decrees forbid to be brought up for accusation; but the executions in cases which come before the collectors shall be levied upon the rest of the debtor's property which is not exempted by the following decree. And they have decreed that in the case of cultivators of Crown land the collectors shall not sell up one house containing their working implements, or their cattle or other equipment necessary for cultivation, nor shall they apply the working implements to working temple land or any other on any pretext whatever. And in the same way they shall not sell the cloth-waeving tools of the cloth-weavers and the byssus-makers and the wool-weavers and all persons engaged in similar trades on any pretext whatever; nor shall any other persons take possession of or use the tools required for cloth-weaving or byssus-manufacture than the tax-payers themselves and the byssus-workers, who alone shall use them in the temples themselves for the service of the sovereigns and the vestments of the other gods. (Lines 248-251) And (they have decreed) that no one holding an official position or any one else shall impose labor upon the cloth-weavers and byssus-workers and robe-weavers gratis or at reduced wages. (Lines 252-264) And they have decreed that no one may appropriate boats for his own use on any pretext whatever. And that neither the strategoi nor any others who are in charge of the Crown, State or sacred interests may arrest any one for a private debt or offence or owing to a private quarrel and keep him imprisoned in their houses or anywhere else on any pretext whatever; but if they accuse any one, they shall bring him before the magistrates appointed in each nome, and shall receive or give satisfaction in accordance with the decrees and regulations.","part","N"

(Lines 252-264) And they have decreed that no one may appropriate boats for his own use on any pretext whatever. And that neither the strategoi nor any others who are in charge of the Crown, State or sacred interests may arrest any one for a private debt or offence or owing to a private quarrel and keep him imprisoned in their houses or anywhere else on any pretext whatever; but if they accuse any one, they shall bring him before the magistrates appointed in each nome, and shall receive or give satisfaction in accordance with the decrees and regulations.","part","N"

The scene below shows ''Osiris N. justified'' presenting a ;round cake; to a bird-soul perched on ;tomb;, a falcon on a shrine, and three enthroned deities whose figures overlap. The falcon is called ''Hotep, great god, lord of the sky.'' A second scene shows ''Osiris N. justified'' ''paddling in Hotep's lake.''

The area is described as ''(the lake) of the hippopotamus, 1000 leagues in length and of untold breadth, containing no fish, no snakes, and no plants.'' The scene below shows deceased ''plowing'' in a region ''the length of which is (the length of) the sky.'' Then follow sowing, reaping, threshing, and two heaps of grain. Beyond these deceased appears seated on the ground under the word ''overflow,'' then standing ''presenting the overflow'' to ''the Inundation, father of the gods.''

"ab","text","The manuscript now starts a little after the beginning of vignette BD 16. Aside from the initial loss, other damage is slight. A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled. Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll. If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass. (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.) But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames. At both beginning and end, it had also been broken across in four places each, and there are minor breaks elsewhere. (Allen p. 16)","type","conservation"

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

(1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O Great One in his Bark, thou hast brought thy Bark, that I may sail upstream to thy ?staircase?.

If they thrive, I thrive; as they thrive, (21)my Spirit thrives, just as my lifetime thrives, according as they say. The provisions of my spirit are like theirs. (24)(O) thou who weighest (in) the balance, may his Truth rise to the nose of Re by day. (O) my spirit, (27)let not (my) head (be taken away) from (me).

(28)To be said by Osiris N.: I (31)know that gate in the middle of the Sky from which Re comes forth, the gate of the eastern Horizon of the Sky, (33)south of which are the fields of the khar{em}-geese and north of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place from which Re sails with the stormwind. I am in charge of announcing (36)in the god's ship. (lxxviii)(BD 108)Spell for knowing the Souls of the west. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: As for (4)that mountain of the eastern range on which this Sky rests, it exists in (6)the eastern Horizon of the Sky. It is 370 hundred-cubits long and 240 cubits broad. (8)Sobk, lord of the Eastern Range, is (9)in the east of that mountain. His Temple is of carnelian. (11)On the summit of the mountain is a snake ?30? cubits long and 10 cubits broad, (13)whose first 3 cubits are of flint. I know the name of this snake (who is) on his mountain; (15)He with Searing Breath is his Name. After midday he turns (17)his eyes against Re. Then a stoppage takes place in the bark and great amazement among the sailors. (19)Then he gulps down 7 cubits of the high water. Then Suty pits (himself) against (21)him, he puts his spear of metal at his neck and causes (23)him to disgorge all that he (has) swallowed. To be said over him as a spell: Fall thou back before the (25)sharp metal that is in my hand. I stand against thee, that (27)the bark's course be true. (O) farseer, close for him thy eyes and veil thy head, that (29)he may cross. Fall back before Osiris N., (for) (31)he is a male in his mother's body. Veil thy head and cool thy upper lip, (for if) I stay sound (33)thou stayest sound. I am the great of magic, son of Nut; given to me is this powerful spell (35)against thee. ''What (is it), thou blessed one?'' (O) goer on his belly and his posterior, thou hast no (vertebra). Behold, (37)Osiris N. is gone, (and) thy strength with him. He it is who has taken over thy strength. (40)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God (for) Re. He has set in the evening after traversing this Sky, while thou art in thy bond(s). This is what has been commanded against thee in the presence of (43)Re. Then Re sets in the life-region (in) his Horizon. I know the Souls of the west. They are Atum, Sobk, lord of the eastern (45)range, and Hathor at evening--said of Isis. (lxxix) (BD 109)Spell for knowing the eastern Souls. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I (3)know that eastern gate of the Sky, south of which is the pool of the khar{em}-geese and north (5)of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place whence Re sails with the stormwind. I am (7)in charge of announcing in the god's ship; I am a tireless paddler in the bark of Re. (9)I know that sycamore of turquoise from the midst of which Re comes forth, which grows on the (uplifted) (11)of Shu at every gate through which Re comes forth. (12)I know that Field of Rushes, whose wall is (14)of metal, the height of (whose) barley is 7 cubits, (15)the ears 2 cubits, its stalks 4 cubits, its wheat 7 cubits, (17)the ears 3 cubits. It is a blessed one 7 cubits tall, each of them, who reaps (19)them alongside the eastern Souls. (20)I know the eastern Souls; they are Harakhte, the calf who is in the presence of this god, and the Morning Star. (22)Osiris N. has built the God's city. ''Proceed thou with them,'' says the Filler, (25)he (who) is the plumb of the scalepan. Bull semen is in the midst of thy tongue, (O) ibis who presidest over (living) beings. (27)Thy counsels in the House of the Snare outweigh ?traps? on papyrus, (O) (29)thou who art cool of mouth while advising. Love of thee is with everyone, (thou) being the divine falcon on the (31)left hand, black of face, whose shoulder is likewise (black), (32)who hast ascended to the Sky with the Starry Host, bearing that coffin, and sailest on the paths without transgressing (34)the boundaries of the (fields) of the Gods. (35)''Writings are with thee, as many as (thou) desirest, in the fields of his joy. (And) to start with grain, wheat is there, (nourished) by the efflux (37)of Sesha. The height of its barley is 5 cubits, the ears 1 cubit. Reap for thyself with (39)the blessed alongside the eastern Souls; enter thou freely into the secret portals, (41)(for) thou art pure,'' say they who are in them. ''Reach thy house by magic, gladdening the heart(s) of (43)thy fledglings. To die again is thy abomination; eternity is thine as lifetime, as a present given as a reward.'' (45)Magnified is the eminence of Osiris N., possessor of worthiness. (lxxxi) (BD 110) [This is a series of scenes with captions; see notes.] (lxxxii) (BD 111)Spell for knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)As for that mountain of the Eastern Range on which this Sky rests, (6)Sobk, lord of the eastern range, is in the summit of that mountain of the eastern range yonder. His Temple is of car(nelian). Head (9)to Whom the Mountain (Makes Obeisance) is his name. He is 80 cubits long and 30 cubits broad, while (12)his first 4 cubits are of flint. After midday he turns his eyes against Re. That means the time is at hand, (and there is) (15)great amazement within his bark. Then Seth pits (himself) against him. He says: ''May the course be true.'' Then he says as (18)a spell: ''(O) farseer, close thou thy eyes and veil thy head. If thou stayest sound, I stay sound; (21)it is I who have taken over strength. Given to me is this (powerful spell) against thee. (23)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God on this day at eventide.'' (25)O Osiris N., raise thyself (28)from thy left side, alive, renewed, youthful like (30)Re every day. Thou shalt never, never die. (lxxxiii) (BD 112)Another spell (for) knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(O) Swamp-Dweller in (the city of) Anpet in the Mendesian nome, Trappers yonder (5)in Pe, Eldest Ones who cannot come, Baker of pots, and ye who stir up loaves, know ye, (8)why Pe was given to Horus? I know, but ye know not. It was Re who gave it to him as recompense for (11)the injury to his eyes, on this (wise): Re said to Horus: ''Let me see this that has happened to thy eye.'' As he was examining it, (14)Re said to Horus: ''Pray look at that black pig.'' (16)After he had been looking at it, then the pains in his eye were very violent. (18)Horus said to Re: ''Behold, my eye (feels) as (it did at) that blow which Seth struck (20)at (my) Eye.'' Then he lost consciousness. Re said to these gods: ''Put him on his bed, that he may recover.'' Seth being come, (23)he had assumed his form of black boar. Then he had struck the blow at the eye of Horus. (So) Re said to these gods: (26)''Abominate the pig for Horus' sake, so that he may recover.'' (Thus) came about the great pig-abomination which these Gods, (29)his attendants, proclaimed for Horus' sake when Horus was in his childhood (and his) sacrifices consisted of his beef cattle, his small cattle, and his pigs. As for (32)Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf, Horus is their Father, and Isis is their Mother. (35)Then Horus said to Re: ''Mayest thou give me my Brother in Pe and in Hieraconpolis of my company (to be) with me, (37)he being with (me by) perpetual assignment, that the earth may grow green and turmoil cease.'' (So) originated (39)his name of Horus on His Papyrus. I know the Souls of Pe. They are Horus, (41)Imset, and Hapi. Lift (42)your face(s), (O) gods who are in the nether world, to Osiris N. Behold, he (45)is become a great god. (lxxxiv) (BD 113)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hieraconpolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I know the secrets of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus and this (5)which his mother did concerning him. Said she: ''Pray let there be brought to us Sobk, lord of the farthest waters, that (7)he may fish (them) out.'' When he (had) found (them), his mother restored (them) to their proper place. Then said Sobk, lord of (9)the farthest waters: ''I sought and found (them, but) they kept slipping out from under my fingers (11)at the water's edge. (So) I netted them (12)with a net by main strength.'' That is how the net originated. Re said: ''Well, (14)why (does) Sobk (have) fish and find Horus' {my} hands for him in Fish Land? Say to Sobk: 'Keep secret (17)the secret about this net which brought Horus' (hands) to him. May it be exposed to view (only) on new-crescent day (19)and midmonth day in Fish Land.' '' Then said Re: ''I have given Hieraconpolis to Horus to (be) (21)the seat of his hands. May his (hands) be exposed to view in Hieraconpolis after they have been brought to him, and confine (23)the (genii) that are in them on new-crescent day and midmonth day.'' (24)Horus said: ''Verily Duamutef and (Qebeh)sen(u)f have been given (to) me (to be) with me, (for) they are the ones of my company that I have kept under guard. As for (the time) while I am there, (27)lo, the god of ?the temple? shall be silent.'' Then said Re: ''Put (them) there, even what thou hast given (29)me. Let there be done for them what is done for those who are in Hieraconpolis. So (shall) their corpse(s be) (31)with thee.'' Then Horus said: ''They were with thee, (but) (32)they shall be with me to hear Seth (and) his complaints.'' (Ye) Souls of Hieraconpolis, (34)(blessedness has been) g(iven) to me. I know the Souls of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf. (lxxxv) (BD 114)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hermopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(There is) ?a thrust (wound)? in the shoulder. Neit shines in the stronghold, and the eye ?consumes? him who judges (6)it. I know and have access to it, I know who brought (8)it from Cusae; (but) I will not tell men nor repeat to gods. I have come (10)on Re's errand (to) confirm the truth of the shoulder, (while) Neit shines in the stronghold (12)to inspect it. (I have) come as a mighty one because of knowing the Souls (14)of Hermopolis. The desire for knowledge is your desire. I know the truth, counted, (16)complete, and enduring. Hail to you, (18)Souls of Hermopolis, in accordance with your knowledge. They are Thoth, Perception, (20)and Atum. (lxxxvi) (BD 115)Spell for ascending to the Sky and gaining access to the underworld. Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I grew large yesterday among the great ones; I came into being among those who had come into being. Look upon the Eye of the One, (6)?open to (me)? the form of darkness, (for) I am one of you. I know the Souls (8)of Heliopolis (and) him to whom (even) he whose strength is greatest has no access when passing by (and about) the extending of a hand (10)to us. ''I give tongue(s) to the gods,'' says he who would destroy the heir of Heliopolis. (12)I know why a tress is made for a male. It is (because) Re spoke (to) the King of Upper Egypt in his time. Then (15)his mouth was mutilated. That is how the diminution on new-crescent day came about. Said Re (to) him who was in his time: ''Take the 'thirty'-spear, (O) heir (18)of (men).'' That is how the court of the thirty originated through him who was in his time. (So) originated the Brother-Sister Pair, (and) so originated the ?6th-day? feast, (and so) originated (21)?he who hears the (spells written on) bright red linen (bandages)? without staying of his hand. (22)Then he assumed his tressed-woman form. So originated the tressed one of Heliopolis. (25)The Mighty had been bared in this temple{s}. So originated the bared one in Heliopolis. When the heir of his heir comes into being, many are (28)the things he shall see; and he shall become the great of strength, the god, even the son who makes (offerings) to his Father. (30)His portion shall become (that of) the great of strength in Heliopolis. (31)I know the Souls of Heliopolis. They are Re and Shu and Tefnut. (lxxxvii) (BD 116)Spell for knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(Neit) shines in Mata(t), truth has been extracted from the shoulder, and (6)the eye has been eaten by Him Who Counted It. I have access to it by the setem-priest, (but I) will not tell men nor (9)repeat to gods, and vice versa. I intrude not into what I know not; I see not the mysteries. Hail to you, (12)ye gods of Hermopolis. He who is large on new-crescent day (and) (diminished) on midmonth day--that is Thoth (15)the mysterious. (The others) are Perception and Atum.

Dung (is) my abomination; I will not eat it. Ordure, (10)?no? harm (shall come) therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, I will not step on it with (12)the soles of my feet, because my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley (14)of the Inundation. It is the Night Bark and the Day Bark that have brought them to me, (and) I eat (16)beneath the boughs of the tamarisks. I know ?the bearer of the good?, (18)so that (I) shall recite for myself the hymn to the white crown and I shall wear the uraeus. O doorkeeper of (20)the Gladdeners of the Two Lands, even these makers of offerings, mayest thou let me bring (as offering) the daughter of truth, and (22)let (the god) Akhem open to me his arm(s). (23)May the Ennead keep silence (while) the sun-folk speak with Osiris N.

(31)The sunshine is clothing the sky among the gods. My portion is there of the bread of their (mouth(s)), ?(the mouths of) the gods?. I have come unto the Disk, (34)I have ascended unto the Moon. He speaks to me, his Followers the gods speak to me, (36)his sun-folk speak to me. They who are in darkness feel terror before me within the Great Flood beside the dreadful one, (39)(for) lo, I am there with Osiris; his mat is my mat. I tell him the words of men; I (repeat) to him the words of the gods: ''Come to me, (42)(O) equipped blessed one, (for) thou hast caused truth to ascend to (him who loves her).''

Osiris (2)N. (saw) the splitting of the ashed-tree{s} beside him in Rosetau. He is the fodder of the gods, who knows what is in their bellie(s). (4)He has come hither to cause to ascend and to testify to the truth and (to) equilibrate the balance among (5)the Silent Ones. O (god) high on his standard, lord of the atef-crown, who has ?set up? his name as lord (6)of the winds, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from thy Messengers who are over evil and bring about punishment, (8)in whose faces is no pity, because Osiris (N.) has done the truth for the Lord of Truth. He is (9)pure, his heart is pure. His front is clean, his rear is undefiled, his middle is (10)the site of truth. Not one of his members is impure. Osiris N. purifies himself in that (southern) site, (he) rests (in) the (12)northern ?district?, in the field of grasshoppers wherein Uto purifies herself at that (13)4th hour of the night and (at the) 8th hour of the day and (s)oothes the hearts of the gods when (14)they pass by night and by day. ''Let him come,'' say they, the gods, (of) Osiris N. ''Who, pray, (art thou)?'' say they to him. ''What, pray, is thy Name?'' (16)say they. I am Osiris N., the (17)lower growth (of) the papyrus plant; He Who Is in His Moringa Tree is the name (of) Osiris N. ''What (didst) thou pass by?'' say they to him. (I) pass(ed) by ?shrines? (19)north of a moringa tree. ''What, pray, didst thou see (there)?'' A leg and ?a thigh?. ''What, pray, (20)didst thou say to them?'' (I) have seen rejoicing in the lands of the Phoenicians. (21)''And what, pray, did they give thee?'' A firebrand and a block of green fayence. ''What, pray, (22)didst thou do with them?'' I buried (them) on that shore of the (m)aa(t)-lake (23)by night. ''And what, pray, didst thou find on it--that shore of the maa(t)-lake?'' (24)A scepter of flint. ''(Didst) thou take it?'' is asked. ''(Did) Osiris N. take it?'' ''What, pray, is (26)this scepter of flint?'' Breath-Giver is its Name. ''What, pray, didst thou do with {it} the firebrand (27)and the block of green fayence after thou hadst buried (them)?'' Osiris N. (exulted) over them, and he took (them) out. (29)He quenched the fire and he smashed the green block by throwing (them) (into the lake). ''Come thou, enter (30)into the broad hall of the City of the Two Truths, (for) thou know(est us).'' ''I will not let thee enter past me,'' (31)says the jamb of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Plumb Bob (of) the Place of Truth is thy name.

''I will not let (35)thee pass by me,'' says the floor (of) this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Pillar of Geb is thy name. (36)''I will not open for thee,'' says the bolt, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' He Whom His Mother ?Announced? is thy name. (37)''I will not open for thee,'' says the ?housing? of the bolt, ''I will not let it (the bolt) go forth,'' says the ?channel? of (38)this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Living Eye of Sobk the Lord of the Eastern Range is thy name. (39)''Thou shalt not open to me, thou shalt not pass me,'' say the double doors, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' (Breast) of Shu when He Presented (40)Himself as Protection of Osiris is thy name. ''We will not let thee pass by us,'' say the rails, ''unless thou tellest (41)our name.'' Brats of Renenutet is your name. ''Thou knowest us; pass on.'' ''Thou shalt not tread upon me,'' (42)says the floor of this broad hall. But why? I am pure. ''Because thou knowest not the name (of) thy feet (43)(with) which thou treadest upon (me).'' I know the name of the feet with which I tread upon thee. ''Then tell me.'' {The seb(44)seb is mine.} Sebseb of Ha is the name of (my) right foot; Wenpet of Nephthys is the name of my (45)left foot. ''Tread thou upon us, for thou knowest us.'' ''(I) will not announce thee,'' says the doorkeeper, ''(un)less thou tellest my name.'' Perceiver (46)of Hearts, Searcher of Bellie(s), is thy name. ''(To) which god on duty shall I announce thee?'' And who, (47)pray, is the god on duty? ''The reckoner of the Two Lands will tell thee.'' And who, pray, is that--the reckoner of the Two Lands? (48)''It is Thoth.'' ''Here I am,'' says Thoth. ''For what purpose hast thou come?'' Osiris N. comes (49)to report. ''What, pray?'' says he to thee. I am pure from (50)all evil deeds. I am aloof from the quarrels of those who are (on duty) in their day; I am not in on them. (51)''(To) whom shall (I) announce thee?'' Announce (me) to (him) whose roof is of fire {of fire}, (52)whose wall is of living cobras, and whose floor is (of) water. ''(Who) is he?'' He is Osiris. ''Proceed, (53)then. Behold, thou art announced. Thy bread is the Sound Eye, thy beer is the Sound Eye; thy mortuary offering is the Sound Eye.'' Triumphant is (54)Osiris N. forever. To be said by (55)a man who is pure, when he has clothed himself in new raiment, is shod with white sandals, is anointed with the finest oil of myrrh, and has presented bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (kinds of) vegetables. Lo, copy for thyself this (text) in writing on a (56)clean ground with Nubian pigment overlaid with soil on which no small cattle have trodden. If this roll is used in his behalf, he shall continue to thrive as (shall) his children's children, (for) he is guiltless. He shall be an intimate of the King (and) his courtiers. There shall be given (57)him a cake, a loaf, milk, and a chunk of meat from the altar of the great god. He shall not be kept away from any gate of the west{erners}. He shall be drawn with the Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. He shall be in the retinue (of) Osiris. A truly excellent spell (proved) a million times.

(xcvi) (BD 126)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O ye 4 baboons who sit at the prow of the bark of Re, who cause (6)truth to ascend to the Lord of the Universe, who judge between the needy and the rich, (8)who gladden the gods with the scorching breath of their mouth(s), who give divine offerings (10)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed, who live on truth and sip (12)of truth, who lie not and whose abomination is sin, may (14)ye remove all evil from me, may ye blot out my sins, (for) no foulness (16)attaches to you. May ye let me penetrate the underworld and enter into Rosetau (18) and pass through the (secret) portals of the west.

Ye are clever and esteemed; ye annihilate (6)the enemies of Re. Ye (il)lumine and dispel your darkness, (while ye see) your holy one and your Elders. Ye live as he lives; (8)ye call to him who is in his Disk. May ye lead me to your road, that my Soul may enter into your secrets. I am one of you; (10)I inspire terror in Apophis, while ye do away with your (foulness) in the west. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, great god who is in his Disk.

May the earth open its twin caverns, while ye make (26)him triumph against his enemies. May ye give offerings to Them of the Nether World. Provide for him the turban rather than (for) its (present) wearer within the secret chamber. (28)''Lo, thou art a great one, the true seed, the soul of a blameless blessed one; thou art one who has control of his hands,'' say they, the Two Comrades, (30)the great and exalted ones, ''(O) Osiris N.'' They rejoice over him, they praise (32)him as (one who is in) their arms. They have given him their magical protection for living. (33)Osiris N. has appeared as the living Soul of Re in the Sky; it has been allotted (35)to him to assume his form. He has been made to triumph in the Council. (36)The gate has been opened for him in sky and earth. (Osiris N., he says: Opened for me is the gate of sky and earth) where the soul of Osiris comes to rest. I have passed through their gate. They rejoice (38)when they see me gone in praised and come out loved. I have (gone on), for no fault of mine has been found and no evil (40)adheres to me. (xcviii) (BD 128) Praising Osiris.

O Osiris, (17)I have come unto thee; I am Horus. (I) have saved thee alive on this day when mortuary offerings of bread and (19)beer, oxen and fowl, and all good things go forth for Osiris. (20)Pray raise thyself, Osiris. I smite for thee thy enemies, (I) save thee from them--I am Horus--(22)on this propitious day at the goodly dawning of thy Soul. (23)It exalt(s thee) with itself on this day in thy Council. O Osiris, thy Spirit comes to thee (to be) (25)with thee, that thou mayest be content in this thy Name of Spirit of Contentment. It bless(es thee) in this thy Name (27)of Blessed One. It praises thee in that thy Name of Magician. It opens for thee the goodly ways (29)in this thy Name of Upwawet. O Osiris, I have come to thee. I put for thee thy enemies (beneath thee) (31)everywhere. Thou dost triumph before the Ennead and the Council. O Osiris, take (33)to thee thy mace, thy standard, and thy stairs beneath thee. Thou presentest gifts to the Gods; thou presentest (35)offerings to those who are in their tomb(s). Thou givest thy greatness to the Gods whom thou hast created, (O) great God. Thou shalt be (37)with (them) as (are) their Mummies; thou shalt embrace all the Gods. Thou shalt hear the voice of Truth (39)today. To be said while offering to this God at the wag-feast. (xcix) (BD 129)Roll for initiating a man and causing that he embark in the bark of Re and his retinue. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (Osiris N. ferries) the Phoenix to Abydos, (4)Osiris to Mendes. He has opened the cave of the Inundation, he has smoothed the way (6)of the Disk, he has drawn Sokar on his sledge, and he makes powerful the Great One in her instant. (8)Osiris N. (has) followed and praises the Disk. He has joined the (sun-)praising (baboons); (11)he is one of them. He has been the companion of Isis and the associate of Nephthys; he has made powerful their magic spell(s). He has attached the towrope. (14)He has repulsed his enemy, he has restrained his steps. Re extends his hands to him; his Crew shall not repulse him. (16)If Osiris N. is powerful, the Sound Eye is powerful, and vice versa. To be said over (19)this Image that is sketched, sketched on a new, clean, unused sheet of papyrus with powder of glaze and (21)myrrh-water, placed at a man's breast without its coming (too) close. He embarks in the bark of Re (23)daily, and Thoth looks after him at disembarking and embarking. A truly excellent spell. Thou shalt sketch it in (25)careful outline, likewise the bark of Re. As for the powder of glaze, it is mentioned in order to emphasize the green, (27)this with which the document is to be written. Osiris N. erects the Pillar and sets up (30)the tie-amulet. He sails wherever he will. (31)Gracious is the remark that Thoth made to Re, the sanctuary being content with its Lord Re. Said Thoth: (33)''Look after his Soul at disembarking and embarking in the bark of Re, while the corpse is to remain in its place.'' (c) (BD 130)Roll for initiating the Soul forever and letting it board the bark of Re to pass by the courtiers of the nether world. (1)To be recited on Osiris' birthday. To be said by Osiris N.: Open, Sky; open (2)earth. Open to me, southerners; open, northerners; open, westerners; open, easterners. Open, double shrine (3)of Upper Egypt; open, double shrine of Lower Egypt. Open, double doors, open, gate(s), to Re, that he may ascend from the Horizon. (4)Open to him, double doors of the Night Bark; open to him, gate(s) of the Day Bark. He inhales Shu; he has created Tefnut. (5)They who are in his train follow him. Osiris N. is (6)Re's follower, one who takes on his character, who provides for his sanctuary like Horus when his fate overtakes him, (7)whose seat is hidden in the ?purity? of his shrine, an envoy of the god to her whom he has loved. Osiris N. has taken (8)(truth); he has offered up her image. He has taken and bound (9)the shrine. He abominates storms; there is no Starry Ho(st) beside him. He has not (been kept away) from Re or Osiris; (10)he has not been warded off by him who accomplishes with his hands. He has not walked in the valley of darkness; he has not entered the lake of the guilty. (11)He is not of those that pour out time; he has not fallen as prey in the place among (those) taken before him (12)around Sopd's slaughtering-place. ?Praise to? you, ?Kneelers?. The God's knife is in concealment; (13)Geb's arms ?become active at? dawn. As for him who is indeed refreshed, he shall lead Older than he and younger in his ((good) time). (14)Now while Thoth is in concealment he (Thoth) has purified (him who takes account of) millions, who opens the sky and dispels cloudiness (15)from about him. (When Osiris N. has reached him) in his seat, he (N.) grasps his staff, he (takes) his scepter, beside Re, (great) (16)(of beautiful goings). The Great One (Re) rises after his eye, (his) Ennead (being around) his seat. They do away with (17)his suffering and his illness when he is sick. Osiris (N.) has done away with his suffering, he refreshes him (N.); illumined for him is the face of Thoth. He praises Re, (and) (19)he (Re) hearkens (to him) and has set up obstacles against his enemies. Osiris N. has not been left boatless, (20)he has not been kept from the Horizon, (for) he is in his knees, for his Name, even Re's name, is in the belly of Osiris (N.) and (22)his dignity is in his mouth. He tells (it) to him, and he hears his words. Praise (be) to thee, Re, lord of the Horizon, Osiris, presider over the westerners. (23)Hail to thee, for whom the sun-folk purify themselves and the Sky brings (offerings) to that great abode past which lead the courses (24)of the rebellious. Behold, Osiris N. is come; he has proclaimed the truth, since {his} marvels are in the west. (25)He has broken the fury of Apophis; he is Ruty. Osiris (N.), he has proclaimed the protection of those who are with him before (26)the great seat. Mayest thou hearken to (him) when Osiris N. enters (27)into the Council. He (drives off) Apophis from Re every day, so that he does not attack him when he wakes. (28)He seizes (the writings); he has received the offerings. He has equipped Thoth with his Eye. He has caused that truth circle about (29)at the prow of the great bark that bears him who is true of speech in the Council. He has established Millions; he has led the courtiers. (30)Osiris N. gives to them a voyage in joy of face. Re's Crew circles about, following (31)his beauty; truth rises high, she circles about her Lord. He (N.) gives praise to the Lord of the Universe. He has taken the staff; (32)he has ?swept? the Sky therewith. The sun-folk give him praise as when rises Horus the unwearying. (33)He exalts Re (by) that which he has done. He has dispelled cloudiness, he has seen his beauty, he has established (34)his course. He circles about, he proceeds to the Bark in the Sky; he shows himself as the sunshine. Osiris N. is the great one in the midst (35)of his eye, sitting (or) kneeling in the great bark of Khepri. He comes into being, and what he says comes into being; he is this (36)which circles the sky toward the west. Verily the Starry Ho(st) rise, while Shu is in rejoicing; they take (37)Re's bow rope from his (crew). As Re circles about, he sees Osiris; entrusted to him is Osiris N. (38)in peace, in peace. He (N.) has not been kept away, he has not been seized, by the scorching breath that is in thy instant. No hindrance has gone forth from thy mouth against him; he has not gone ?with? the crocodile. (39)His abomination is crocodiles; they have not attacked him. He embarks in thy bark; he takes over thy throne. He assumes thy dignity; he follows the paths of Re. (40)His praises shall drive away that noxious one who comes aflame against (thy) Bark (in) this great district. Osiris N., he knows him; (41)he cannot reach thy bark (while) Osiris N. is (therein). It is he who makes offerings to the Gods and mortuary offerings (42)to the blessed. To be said over an image of this initiate put into this bark, after thou hast made the Night Bark at its right side and the Day Bark (43)at its left side. Offer to them bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (other) good things on Osiris' birthday. If this is done for him, (44)his Soul shall stay alive forever. It shall not die again. (This is) a secret of the nether world, a mystery in the god's domain. Found in the Palace of the Great House (45)under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ?Khasety? justified, (as though) found in a mountain cave. (This) is what Horus used (for) his Father Osiris Unnofer justified. Since Re looks upon (46)this blessed one as himself, looks upon him as upon his Ennead, great is the fear of him, great is the esteem of him in the heart(s) of men and Gods and the blessed and the dead. His corpse and (47)his Soul shall live forever; he shall not die again in the god's domain. He shall not be left over on the judgment day; he shall be justified against his enemies. His offerings shall be on (48)the altar of Re daily. (ci) (BD 131)Spell for proceeding to the Sky beside Re. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Re it is who shines this night. As for every man who is in his train, he shall stay alive as a follower (6)of Thoth. He shall give ?the crown? to Horus this night and joy to Osiris, be(8)cause he is one among these while his enemies are well disposed of.","part","N"

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

The falcon is called ''Hotep, great god, lord of the sky.'' A second scene shows ''Osiris N. justified'' ''paddling in Hotep's lake.''

In ovals at upper left are four place names: ''Djef(a)t, (Hezat), the Powerful, and the United.'' Below float two barks, each on its own canal. That at left is ''the bark of Re-Harakhte when he crosses to the Field of Rush(es).'' That in center is described as ''the holy throne; the god who occupies it is Unnofer.'' Uncertain legends are ;zeh mw; (T: ;azehen mw; pet), possibly ''disturbing the water,'' above the pair of barks, and ;rekhyt, ''common folk,''; as name of a ;pool; at lower left. BD 110c is a vignette only, in four registers, each under its own sky. At top a beardless deity squats enshrined on a bark behind which stand Isis and Nephthys. In the next panel deceased stands praying while Harpocrates presents offerings to enthroned Osiris flanked by standing Isis. In each of the bottom two registers, deceased kneels while presenting offerings to two squatting gods.","anchored","true"

"ab","text","The manuscript now starts a little after the beginning of vignette BD 16. Aside from the initial loss, other damage is slight. A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled. Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll. If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass. (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.) But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames. At both beginning and end, it had also been broken across in four places each, and there are minor breaks elsewhere. (Allen p. 16)","type","conservation"

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text. Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.;There are vignettes associated with BD 16-7, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 35-41, 43, 45, 47, 46, 44, 48, 53, 50, 54-5, 52, 57, 59, 56, 63, 65-6, 68, 71-87, 89, 90, 88, 91-4, 98-9, 95, 100-7, 109-10, 112-5, 119, 116-7, 124-36, 138, 137, 140, 143-62, 191. Most, if not all, of the vignettes were evidently sketched in ahead of the text, and the latter did not always fit as the artist had planned. (Allen p. 19);BD 110b consists of 3 registers. Top register: Three cities are named in ovals: ''Qen{q}qenet, (Hetepet), and the City of the Great One.'' Then follows a statement: ''Existing as Hotep, lord of the fields, with breath in (his) nose.'' The scene below shows ''Osiris N. justified'' presenting a ;round cake; to a bird-soul perched on ;tomb;, a falcon on a shrine, and three enthroned deities whose figures overlap. The falcon is called ''Hotep, great god, lord of the sky.'' A second scene shows ''Osiris N. justified'' ''paddling in Hotep's lake.'' In the third scene Thoth serves as scribe, while ''Osiris N. justified'' followed by two associates offers incense to ''the Great Ennead.''

Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text. Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.;There are vignettes associated with BD 16-7, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 35-41, 43, 45, 47, 46, 44, 48, 53, 50, 54-5, 52, 57, 59, 56, 63, 65-6, 68, 71-87, 89, 90, 88, 91-4, 98-9, 95, 100-7, 109-10, 112-5, 119, 116-7, 124-36, 138, 137, 140, 143-62, 191. Most, if not all, of the vignettes were evidently sketched in ahead of the text, and the latter did not always fit as the artist had planned. (Allen p. 19);BD 110b consists of 3 registers. Top register: Three cities are named in ovals: ''Qen{q}qenet, (Hetepet), and the City of the Great One.'' Then follows a statement: ''Existing as Hotep, lord of the fields, with breath in (his) nose.'' The scene below shows ''Osiris N. justified'' presenting a ;round cake; to a bird-soul perched on ;tomb;, a falcon on a shrine, and three enthroned deities whose figures overlap. The falcon is called ''Hotep, great god, lord of the sky.'' A second scene shows ''Osiris N. justified'' ''paddling in Hotep's lake.'' In the third scene Thoth serves as scribe, while ''Osiris N. justified'' followed by two associates offers incense to ''the Great Ennead.'' Middle register: At top are named four ;islets;: ''the Peaceful, Anet-wadj(-wer), the Verdant, and ....

A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled. Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll. If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass. (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.) But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames.

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

"p","text","The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60. In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions. They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15). Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript. Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous. Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas. A note in demotic is added below BD 140. All of the writing is in black. The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD. The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red. The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand. He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his. But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii). The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person. His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

"ab","text","P. OIM 9787 (3), continued: (lxix) (BD94)Behold me; (14)I am a scribe ?through what has been written for me?. Bring me the putrid effluent of (16)Osiris, that I may write (there)with. I do what the god great of beauty has said (18)every day. My beauty is the beauty that Re-Har(akhte) assigns me. (20)I do righteousness, that I may go unto Re every day. (21)(BD 95)Spell for opening beside Thoth. (22)To be said by Osiris N.: (25) It is I who was terror among the raging, who was guardian of the Coil in the conflict. (28)I smote the violent one, Ash; I cool(ed) Ash off. I acted in behalf of the house of the Great One (in the conflict). (31)I steadied the sharp knife in the hand of Khepri ?among? the raging. (lxx)(BD96)Spell for opening beside Thoth and putting the blessed (3)into the god's domain. To be said by Osiris N.: (8)I am the center of his eye; I have come to give truth to Re. (11)I have appeased the King of Upper Egypt with the spittle (of the Earth-God (and) with) blood from (14)Geb's worthy ones. (BD 97)To be said (15)in the Night Bark. (O) scepter (of) Anubis, I have appeased those blessed ones who are in (18)the retinue (of) the lord{s} of (offerings). {Variant:} I am (lord of) fields; (20)I am (father) of the overflow that drives away (my) thirst and guardian of (the pool). (23)Just see me, ye Great and powerful gods who preside over the Souls (26)of Heliopolis. I am high above your head(s); I am the beneficent one who is in (29)your heart(s). Behold, I reverence (my) Soul, a Great and powerful one; I have not been given over to (32)that harm that came forth from your mouth(s). (It) is gone; it turned not upon me. (35)I purified myself in the pool for appeasing the judge with the divine fillet under the sycamores (38)of the god's possessions in the sky, while all the previous triumphant ones were refreshing themselves. (41)Arrive, come to me, (hasten), truth, (for mine is) the correct and upright one who is in the earth. I am (the interpreter of his speech), (44)the Might of the sole Lord Re the great, who lives on truth. (46)(Do) no harm (against) me; unveil the day first of all. (lxxi) (BD 98)Spell for bringing the ferry. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Hail to thee, thou district that is in the northern sky in the (6)great lake. He who sees (thee) dies not. I stand upon (thee), appearing (8)as a god. I see (thee, and) I die not as I stand; (10)I live, appearing as a god. I honk as a semen-goose; (12)I weep as that falcon over the ?fragrant pate of? the Great One. (15)I cross the earth to the Sky, I stand as Shu. Akhkhew stands firm, (17)supporting the ladder that lets the Unweariable (Stars) ascend exempt from (20)decapitation. I have brought these warders-off of evil as I pass by the waret of Ptah. (24)'' Whence hast thou come (to) Ptah?'' (I have come) from the sea of fire and from the fields of flame. (27)''What dost thou live on in the sea (of) {my} fire and in the fields of flame?'' I live (30)on that august tree. ''O planner, bring to him these ships from ?the twin (33)hair-lakes?--to the well and comfortable one.'' I stand up in the bark and rule (35)the water as a god. I stand, ?trunk{s} and branches?, (when) the traveler embarks. Opened (38)for me are the gates in Letopolis; set aside for me are fields (41)in Hermopolis. Given me is shenes-bread in the presence of the Heir. (lxxii) (BD 99)Spell for bringing the ferryboat in the god's domain. To be said by Osiris N.: (2)O thou who bringest the ferryboat from the deep over yon bad shoal, bring me the ferryboat, (4)attach for me the towrope, in peace, in peace. Come, come; hasten, (5)hasten. I have come to see for myself my Father Osiris. O lord of red linen, who controllest hearts, O lord of storm, (7)virile one who sails over that shoal of Apophis, O thou who attachest heads and keepest necks firm by escape (8)from wounds, O attendant of the mysterious ferryboat, (thou) who restrainest Apophis, bring me the ferryboat, (9)attach for me the towrope, that I may go forth from it, this difficult terrain where the Topsy-turvy (Stars) fall (on) their face(s) (10)and cannot rise (again).

(1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O Great One in his Bark, thou hast brought thy Bark, that I may sail upstream to thy ?staircase?.

(15)It is the night bark and the day bark that bring (them) (to) me. ?Gifts? have been (pro)vided like barley from the altar of the Souls of Heliopolis by (...).

(12)Overlook thou (this) evil utterance which I have said and this evil wrong (15)which I have committed, without giving (me) over to them, for mine is this natural green papyrus-amulet that is at the throat (18)of Re and is given to the Horizon-Dwellers. If they thrive, I thrive; as they thrive, (21)my Spirit thrives, just as my lifetime thrives, according as they say. The provisions of my spirit are like theirs. (24)(O) thou who weighest (in) the balance, may his Truth rise to the nose of Re by day. (O) my spirit, (27)let not (my) head (be taken away) from (me). (28)(For) mine is an eye that sees, mine are ears that hear. I am not a (30)sacrificial bull; none of me shall become a mortuary offering to those who are over Nut. (lxxvii) (BD 106)Spell for giving offerings in Memphis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Great One, lord of provisions, O Great One presiding over the upper houses, (ye) who give (8)bread to Ptah, give ye me bread, give ye me beer.

I am in charge of announcing (36)in the god's ship. (lxxviii)(BD 108)Spell for knowing the Souls of the west. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: As for (4)that mountain of the eastern range on which this Sky rests, it exists in (6)the eastern Horizon of the Sky. It is 370 hundred-cubits long and 240 cubits broad. (8)Sobk, lord of the Eastern Range, is (9)in the east of that mountain. His Temple is of carnelian. (11)On the summit of the mountain is a snake ?30? cubits long and 10 cubits broad, (13)whose first 3 cubits are of flint. I know the name of this snake (who is) on his mountain; (15)He with Searing Breath is his Name. After midday he turns (17)his eyes against Re. Then a stoppage takes place in the bark and great amazement among the sailors. (19)Then he gulps down 7 cubits of the high water. Then Suty pits (himself) against (21)him, he puts his spear of metal at his neck and causes (23)him to disgorge all that he (has) swallowed. To be said over him as a spell: Fall thou back before the (25)sharp metal that is in my hand. I stand against thee, that (27)the bark's course be true. (O) farseer, close for him thy eyes and veil thy head, that (29)he may cross. Fall back before Osiris N., (for) (31)he is a male in his mother's body. Veil thy head and cool thy upper lip, (for if) I stay sound (33)thou stayest sound. I am the great of magic, son of Nut; given to me is this powerful spell (35)against thee. ''What (is it), thou blessed one?'' (O) goer on his belly and his posterior, thou hast no (vertebra). Behold, (37)Osiris N. is gone, (and) thy strength with him. He it is who has taken over thy strength. (40)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God (for) Re. He has set in the evening after traversing this Sky, while thou art in thy bond(s). This is what has been commanded against thee in the presence of (43)Re. Then Re sets in the life-region (in) his Horizon. I know the Souls of the west. They are Atum, Sobk, lord of the eastern (45)range, and Hathor at evening--said of Isis. (lxxix) (BD 109)Spell for knowing the eastern Souls. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I (3)know that eastern gate of the Sky, south of which is the pool of the khar{em}-geese and north (5)of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place whence Re sails with the stormwind. I am (7)in charge of announcing in the god's ship; I am a tireless paddler in the bark of Re. (9)I know that sycamore of turquoise from the midst of which Re comes forth, which grows on the (uplifted) (11)of Shu at every gate through which Re comes forth. (12)I know that Field of Rushes, whose wall is (14)of metal, the height of (whose) barley is 7 cubits, (15)the ears 2 cubits, its stalks 4 cubits, its wheat 7 cubits, (17)the ears 3 cubits. It is a blessed one 7 cubits tall, each of them, who reaps (19)them alongside the eastern Souls. (20)I know the eastern Souls; they are Harakhte, the calf who is in the presence of this god, and the Morning Star. (22)Osiris N. has built the God's city. ''Proceed thou with them,'' says the Filler, (25)he (who) is the plumb of the scalepan. Bull semen is in the midst of thy tongue, (O) ibis who presidest over (living) beings. (27)Thy counsels in the House of the Snare outweigh ?traps? on papyrus, (O) (29)thou who art cool of mouth while advising. Love of thee is with everyone, (thou) being the divine falcon on the (31)left hand, black of face, whose shoulder is likewise (black), (32)who hast ascended to the Sky with the Starry Host, bearing that coffin, and sailest on the paths without transgressing (34)the boundaries of the (fields) of the Gods. (35)''Writings are with thee, as many as (thou) desirest, in the fields of his joy. (And) to start with grain, wheat is there, (nourished) by the efflux (37)of Sesha. The height of its barley is 5 cubits, the ears 1 cubit. Reap for thyself with (39)the blessed alongside the eastern Souls; enter thou freely into the secret portals, (41)(for) thou art pure,'' say they who are in them. ''Reach thy house by magic, gladdening the heart(s) of (43)thy fledglings. To die again is thy abomination; eternity is thine as lifetime, as a present given as a reward.'' (45)Magnified is the eminence of Osiris N., possessor of worthiness. (lxxxi) (BD 110) [This is a series of scenes with captions; see notes.] (lxxxii) (BD 111)Spell for knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)As for that mountain of the Eastern Range on which this Sky rests, (6)Sobk, lord of the eastern range, is in the summit of that mountain of the eastern range yonder. His Temple is of car(nelian). Head (9)to Whom the Mountain (Makes Obeisance) is his name. He is 80 cubits long and 30 cubits broad, while (12)his first 4 cubits are of flint. After midday he turns his eyes against Re. That means the time is at hand, (and there is) (15)great amazement within his bark. Then Seth pits (himself) against him. He says: ''May the course be true.'' Then he says as (18)a spell: ''(O) farseer, close thou thy eyes and veil thy head. If thou stayest sound, I stay sound; (21)it is I who have taken over strength. Given to me is this (powerful spell) against thee. (23)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God on this day at eventide.'' (25)O Osiris N., raise thyself (28)from thy left side, alive, renewed, youthful like (30)Re every day. Thou shalt never, never die. (lxxxiii) (BD 112)Another spell (for) knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(O) Swamp-Dweller in (the city of) Anpet in the Mendesian nome, Trappers yonder (5)in Pe, Eldest Ones who cannot come, Baker of pots, and ye who stir up loaves, know ye, (8)why Pe was given to Horus? I know, but ye know not. It was Re who gave it to him as recompense for (11)the injury to his eyes, on this (wise): Re said to Horus: ''Let me see this that has happened to thy eye.'' As he was examining it, (14)Re said to Horus: ''Pray look at that black pig.'' (16)After he had been looking at it, then the pains in his eye were very violent. (18)Horus said to Re: ''Behold, my eye (feels) as (it did at) that blow which Seth struck (20)at (my) Eye.'' Then he lost consciousness. Re said to these gods: ''Put him on his bed, that he may recover.'' Seth being come, (23)he had assumed his form of black boar. Then he had struck the blow at the eye of Horus. (So) Re said to these gods: (26)''Abominate the pig for Horus' sake, so that he may recover.'' (Thus) came about the great pig-abomination which these Gods, (29)his attendants, proclaimed for Horus' sake when Horus was in his childhood (and his) sacrifices consisted of his beef cattle, his small cattle, and his pigs. As for (32)Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf, Horus is their Father, and Isis is their Mother. (35)Then Horus said to Re: ''Mayest thou give me my Brother in Pe and in Hieraconpolis of my company (to be) with me, (37)he being with (me by) perpetual assignment, that the earth may grow green and turmoil cease.'' (So) originated (39)his name of Horus on His Papyrus. I know the Souls of Pe. They are Horus, (41)Imset, and Hapi. Lift (42)your face(s), (O) gods who are in the nether world, to Osiris N. Behold, he (45)is become a great god. (lxxxiv) (BD 113)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hieraconpolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I know the secrets of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus and this (5)which his mother did concerning him. Said she: ''Pray let there be brought to us Sobk, lord of the farthest waters, that (7)he may fish (them) out.'' When he (had) found (them), his mother restored (them) to their proper place. Then said Sobk, lord of (9)the farthest waters: ''I sought and found (them, but) they kept slipping out from under my fingers (11)at the water's edge. (So) I netted them (12)with a net by main strength.'' That is how the net originated. Re said: ''Well, (14)why (does) Sobk (have) fish and find Horus' {my} hands for him in Fish Land? Say to Sobk: 'Keep secret (17)the secret about this net which brought Horus' (hands) to him. May it be exposed to view (only) on new-crescent day (19)and midmonth day in Fish Land.' '' Then said Re: ''I have given Hieraconpolis to Horus to (be) (21)the seat of his hands. May his (hands) be exposed to view in Hieraconpolis after they have been brought to him, and confine (23)the (genii) that are in them on new-crescent day and midmonth day.'' (24)Horus said: ''Verily Duamutef and (Qebeh)sen(u)f have been given (to) me (to be) with me, (for) they are the ones of my company that I have kept under guard. As for (the time) while I am there, (27)lo, the god of ?the temple? shall be silent.'' Then said Re: ''Put (them) there, even what thou hast given (29)me. Let there be done for them what is done for those who are in Hieraconpolis. So (shall) their corpse(s be) (31)with thee.'' Then Horus said: ''They were with thee, (but) (32)they shall be with me to hear Seth (and) his complaints.'' (Ye) Souls of Hieraconpolis, (34)(blessedness has been) g(iven) to me. I know the Souls of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf. (lxxxv) (BD 114)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hermopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(There is) ?a thrust (wound)? in the shoulder. Neit shines in the stronghold, and the eye ?consumes? him who judges (6)it. I know and have access to it, I know who brought (8)it from Cusae; (but) I will not tell men nor repeat to gods. I have come (10)on Re's errand (to) confirm the truth of the shoulder, (while) Neit shines in the stronghold (12)to inspect it. (I have) come as a mighty one because of knowing the Souls (14)of Hermopolis. The desire for knowledge is your desire. I know the truth, counted, (16)complete, and enduring. Hail to you, (18)Souls of Hermopolis, in accordance with your knowledge. They are Thoth, Perception, (20)and Atum. (lxxxvi) (BD 115)Spell for ascending to the Sky and gaining access to the underworld. Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis.

Look upon the Eye of the One, (6)?open to (me)? the form of darkness, (for) I am one of you. I know the Souls (8)of Heliopolis (and) him to whom (even) he whose strength is greatest has no access when passing by (and about) the extending of a hand (10)to us. ''I give tongue(s) to the gods,'' says he who would destroy the heir of Heliopolis. (12)I know why a tress is made for a male. It is (because) Re spoke (to) the King of Upper Egypt in his time. Then (15)his mouth was mutilated. That is how the diminution on new-crescent day came about. Said Re (to) him who was in his time: ''Take the 'thirty'-spear, (O) heir (18)of (men).'' That is how the court of the thirty originated through him who was in his time. (So) originated the Brother-Sister Pair, (and) so originated the ?6th-day? feast, (and so) originated (21)?he who hears the (spells written on) bright red linen (bandages)? without staying of his hand. (22)Then he assumed his tressed-woman form. So originated the tressed one of Heliopolis. (25)The Mighty had been bared in this temple{s}. So originated the bared one in Heliopolis. When the heir of his heir comes into being, many are (28)the things he shall see; and he shall become the great of strength, the god, even the son who makes (offerings) to his Father. (30)His portion shall become (that of) the great of strength in Heliopolis. (31)I know the Souls of Heliopolis. They are Re and Shu and Tefnut. (lxxxvii) (BD 116)Spell for knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(Neit) shines in Mata(t), truth has been extracted from the shoulder, and (6)the eye has been eaten by Him Who Counted It. I have access to it by the setem-priest, (but I) will not tell men nor (9)repeat to gods, and vice versa. I intrude not into what I know not; I see not the mysteries. Hail to you, (12)ye gods of Hermopolis. He who is large on new-crescent day (and) (diminished) on midmonth day--that is Thoth (15)the mysterious. (The others) are Perception and Atum. (17)(BD 117)Spell for taking the road in Rosetau. (19)To be said by Osiris N.: The road of my face is (22)toward Rosetau. It is I who clothed the great one with Greatness. I have come, I have come; I have established offerings in Abydos. (25)Open for me the road in Rosetau, (for) I have healed things in Osiris. (27)I am one who created water and assigned (his) throne. Make {my} way for me in the valley (and) in the lake of the Great One. Make (30)way for me, ?(for) thine and his am I?. (lxxxviii) (BD 118)Spell for reaching Rosetau. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (5)I am one who was born in Rosetau. Magic power has been given me (b)y those who are with (8)the mummies (as) a priest of Osiris. (I) receive (10)old age in Rosetau; I lead (the gods) through ?the (temple) doors? of Osiris. I am (13)the way, leading to them through the twin abodes of Osiris. (15)(BD 119)Spell for going forth from Rosetau. To be said by (17)Osiris N.: I am (20)the Great One who created his light. I have come unto thee (that I may praise thee) while washing away (23)thy efflux far from thee. (24)I set up my name in Rosetau, my power in Abydos. Pray raise (27)thyself, Osiris, that thou mayest circle this sky with Re, that thou mayest see (29)the common folk. Sole one in the service of Re, lo, he says to thee: (31)''Osiris N. is the mummy of the god.'' (34)What he says comes to pass. He cannot be kept away from thee, Osiris. (36)(BD 120)Spell for going in and out. (37)To be said by Osiris N.: ?Praise (40)to? thee, Re. Behold, now, (things) more mysterious than the nether world: the scepter and that stake of Geb and that balance (41)of Re wherein he weighs truth every day. Behold, I hoe the earth. Mayest thou let me come aged. (lxxxix) (BD 122)Spell for going in af(ter) going out of the god's domain. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Open to me, since thou art become divine through me.

(37)I seized the ad(w)-fish when he retreated; I (have) done what thou didst command against him. (40)I lay down afterward (within) my eye. I am free from harm; I have come. (xci) (BD 124)Spell for entering the presence of the Council of Osiris. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)My Soul builds a stronghold in Mendes; my crops are in Pe. (5)I have plowed (my) fields in (my normal) form. (My) doum palms are as (those of) Min above th(em). My abomination is my abomination; (8)I will not eat it. Dung (is) my abomination; I will not eat it. Ordure, (10)?no? harm (shall come) therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, I will not step on it with (12)the soles of my feet, because my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley (14)of the Inundation. It is the Night Bark and the Day Bark that have brought them to me, (and) I eat (16)beneath the boughs of the tamarisks. I know ?the bearer of the good?, (18)so that (I) shall recite for myself the hymn to the white crown and I shall wear the uraeus. O doorkeeper of (20)the Gladdeners of the Two Lands, even these makers of offerings, mayest thou let me bring (as offering) the daughter of truth, and (22)let (the god) Akhem open to me his arm(s). (23)May the Ennead keep silence (while) the sun-folk speak with Osiris N. (O thou) who guidest (26)the heart(s) of the gods, (my) power protects (me) in the sky (among) the Divine Images, the Creators. As for (28)any god or any goddess who may interfere with me, he is assigned to the progenitor(s) of Re, he is assigned to the Progenitors of the light. (31)The sunshine is clothing the sky among the gods. My portion is there of the bread of their (mouth(s)), ?(the mouths of) the gods?. I have come unto the Disk, (34)I have ascended unto the Moon. He speaks to me, his Followers the gods speak to me, (36)his sun-folk speak to me. They who are in darkness feel terror before me within the Great Flood beside the dreadful one, (39)(for) lo, I am there with Osiris; his mat is my mat. I tell him the words of men; I (repeat) to him the words of the gods: ''Come to me, (42)(O) equipped blessed one, (for) thou hast caused truth to ascend to (him who loves her).'' (43)I am a blessed one (better) equipped than any (other) blessed one, (as) perfect as the mummies of Heliopolis, Mendes, Heracleopolis, Abydos, Akhmim, and ?the Sanctuary?. (46)Osiris N. is triumphant along with every god and every goddess who is hidden in the god's domain.

(Say) 4 times. My purity is the purity of that great phoenix that is in Heracleopolis, because I am that nose (34)(of) the lord of the winds who keeps alive all the common folk on that day of seeking the lord of the Sound Eye in Heliopolis on the last day of month 2 of the second season in the presence of the Lord of this land. (36)I have seen the filling of the Sound Eye in Heliopolis.

To be said by Osiris N.: Hail to you, gods (38)who are in the broad hall of the Two Truths, in whose bellie(s) is no falsehood, who live on (39)truth in Heliopolis and swallow (it) in their heart(s) in the presence of Horus who is in his Disk. May (40)ye rescue me from Baby, who lives on the entrails of the Elders, on that day of the great accounting. Behold Osiris N. (42)is come unto you. He is without sin, he is without (guilt), he is without evil, (43)he is without a witness. Nothing shall be done against him. He lives on truth, he sips of truth. (44)He has been joyous of heart; he (has) done what men request and what the gods (are pleased) with. He has gladdened the god (45)with his desire. He has provided bread for the hungry, water for the thirsty, clothing for (46)the naked. He has given (use of) a ferryboat (to) the boatless. He has given offerings (47)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed. May ye indeed rescue him, may (48)ye indeed protect him {because}. Ye shall not complain against him before the lord of mummies, (49)for his mouth is clean and his hands are clean (and he is one) (to whom is said) ''Welcome, welcome, in peace,'' (50)(b)y those who see him, because Osiris N. hear(d) (51)that important conversation which the ass held with the cat in the house of the Open- (xciv) (1)mouthed One. ?He testifies (that)? when he looked behind him he uttered a cry. Osiris (2)N. (saw) the splitting of the ashed-tree{s} beside him in Rosetau. He is the fodder of the gods, who knows what is in their bellie(s). (4)He has come hither to cause to ascend and to testify to the truth and (to) equilibrate the balance among (5)the Silent Ones. O (god) high on his standard, lord of the atef-crown, who has ?set up? his name as lord (6)of the winds, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from thy Messengers who are over evil and bring about punishment, (8)in whose faces is no pity, because Osiris (N.) has done the truth for the Lord of Truth. He is (9)pure, his heart is pure. His front is clean, his rear is undefiled, his middle is (10)the site of truth. Not one of his members is impure. Osiris N. purifies himself in that (southern) site, (he) rests (in) the (12)northern ?district?, in the field of grasshoppers wherein Uto purifies herself at that (13)4th hour of the night and (at the) 8th hour of the day and (s)oothes the hearts of the gods when (14)they pass by night and by day. ''Let him come,'' say they, the gods, (of) Osiris N. ''Who, pray, (art thou)?'' say they to him. ''What, pray, is thy Name?'' (16)say they. I am Osiris N., the (17)lower growth (of) the papyrus plant; He Who Is in His Moringa Tree is the name (of) Osiris N. ''What (didst) thou pass by?'' say they to him. (I) pass(ed) by ?shrines? (19)north of a moringa tree. ''What, pray, didst thou see (there)?'' A leg and ?a thigh?. ''What, pray, (20)didst thou say to them?'' (I) have seen rejoicing in the lands of the Phoenicians. (21)''And what, pray, did they give thee?'' A firebrand and a block of green fayence. ''What, pray, (22)didst thou do with them?'' I buried (them) on that shore of the (m)aa(t)-lake (23)by night. ''And what, pray, didst thou find on it--that shore of the maa(t)-lake?'' (24)A scepter of flint. ''(Didst) thou take it?'' is asked. ''(Did) Osiris N. take it?'' ''What, pray, is (26)this scepter of flint?'' Breath-Giver is its Name. ''What, pray, didst thou do with {it} the firebrand (27)and the block of green fayence after thou hadst buried (them)?'' Osiris N. (exulted) over them, and he took (them) out. (29)He quenched the fire and he smashed the green block by throwing (them) (into the lake). ''Come thou, enter (30)into the broad hall of the City of the Two Truths, (for) thou know(est us).'' ''I will not let thee enter past me,'' (31)says the jamb of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Plumb Bob (of) the Place of Truth is thy name. (32)''I will not let thee enter past me,'' says the right-hand ?beam? of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Master of the Counting of Hearts is thy name. ''I will not let (35)thee pass by me,'' says the floor (of) this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Pillar of Geb is thy name. (36)''I will not open for thee,'' says the bolt, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' He Whom His Mother ?Announced? is thy name. (37)''I will not open for thee,'' says the ?housing? of the bolt, ''I will not let it (the bolt) go forth,'' says the ?channel? of (38)this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Living Eye of Sobk the Lord of the Eastern Range is thy name. (39)''Thou shalt not open to me, thou shalt not pass me,'' say the double doors, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' (Breast) of Shu when He Presented (40)Himself as Protection of Osiris is thy name. ''We will not let thee pass by us,'' say the rails, ''unless thou tellest (41)our name.'' Brats of Renenutet is your name. ''Thou knowest us; pass on.'' ''Thou shalt not tread upon me,'' (42)says the floor of this broad hall. But why? I am pure. ''Because thou knowest not the name (of) thy feet (43)(with) which thou treadest upon (me).'' I know the name of the feet with which I tread upon thee. ''Then tell me.'' {The seb(44)seb is mine.} Sebseb of Ha is the name of (my) right foot; Wenpet of Nephthys is the name of my (45)left foot. ''Tread thou upon us, for thou knowest us.'' ''(I) will not announce thee,'' says the doorkeeper, ''(un)less thou tellest my name.'' Perceiver (46)of Hearts, Searcher of Bellie(s), is thy name. ''(To) which god on duty shall I announce thee?'' And who, (47)pray, is the god on duty? ''The reckoner of the Two Lands will tell thee.'' And who, pray, is that--the reckoner of the Two Lands? (48)''It is Thoth.'' ''Here I am,'' says Thoth. ''For what purpose hast thou come?'' Osiris N. comes (49)to report. ''What, pray?'' says he to thee. I am pure from (50)all evil deeds. I am aloof from the quarrels of those who are (on duty) in their day; I am not in on them. (51)''(To) whom shall (I) announce thee?'' Announce (me) to (him) whose roof is of fire {of fire}, (52)whose wall is of living cobras, and whose floor is (of) water. ''(Who) is he?'' He is Osiris. ''Proceed, (53)then. Behold, thou art announced. Thy bread is the Sound Eye, thy beer is the Sound Eye; thy mortuary offering is the Sound Eye.'' Triumphant is (54)Osiris N. forever. To be said by (55)a man who is pure, when he has clothed himself in new raiment, is shod with white sandals, is anointed with the finest oil of myrrh, and has presented bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (kinds of) vegetables. Lo, copy for thyself this (text) in writing on a (56)clean ground with Nubian pigment overlaid with soil on which no small cattle have trodden. If this roll is used in his behalf, he shall continue to thrive as (shall) his children's children, (for) he is guiltless. He shall be an intimate of the King (and) his courtiers. There shall be given (57)him a cake, a loaf, milk, and a chunk of meat from the altar of the great god. He shall not be kept away from any gate of the west{erners}. He shall be drawn with the Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. He shall be in the retinue (of) Osiris. A truly excellent spell (proved) a million times.

(xcvi) (BD 126)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O ye 4 baboons who sit at the prow of the bark of Re, who cause (6)truth to ascend to the Lord of the Universe, who judge between the needy and the rich, (8)who gladden the gods with the scorching breath of their mouth(s), who give divine offerings (10)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed, who live on truth and sip (12)of truth, who lie not and whose abomination is sin, may (14)ye remove all evil from me, may ye blot out my sins, (for) no foulness (16)attaches to you. May ye let me penetrate the underworld and enter into Rosetau (18) and pass through the (secret) portals of the west. Then shall ye give me a cake and (20)a loaf like these blessed ones who go in and out of Rosetau. (22)Pass; come thou. I have removed thy evil, I have blotted out (24)thy sins. What would harm thee is disposed of; I have done away with the evil that attached to thee. Enter (26)thou into Rosetau. Thou passest through the secret portals of the west; (28)thou goest out and in (at) will like these blessed ones. Thou art summoned every day within (30)the horizon. (xcvii) (BD 127)Roll for praising the cave-gods. Said by a man on reaching them and entering to see this god in the house of the nether world. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Hail to you, cave-gods (3)who are in the west. Hail to you, Doorkeepers of the Gates, (4)who guard this god and report before Osiris. Ye are clever and esteemed; ye annihilate (6)the enemies of Re. Ye (il)lumine and dispel your darkness, (while ye see) your holy one and your Elders. Ye live as he lives; (8)ye call to him who is in his Disk. May ye lead me to your road, that my Soul may enter into your secrets. I am one of you; (10)I inspire terror in Apophis, while ye do away with your (foulness) in the west. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, great god who is in his Disk. (12)Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, Osiris presiding over the west, great god, lord of Abydos. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies in sky and earth, Osiris N., (14)even southerners and northerners, westerners and easterners. He follows Osiris presiding over the westerners; (16)he is praised before him in the valley. He triumphs in the great Council, he triumphs in the nether world, like the Starry Host. The flame (18) of his Soul shall consume the corpses of the dead (who) enter into misfortune and whose wrapping is (that of) the perished. (20)(Ye) who make righteous the Souls of all the blameless blessed and serve the Sacred Land in the house of life, mistress of Souls, (22)according as Re is praised and according as Osiris is praised, may ye guide Osiris N., (24)may ye open for him the gates of the nether world. May the earth open its twin caverns, while ye make (26)him triumph against his enemies. May ye give offerings to Them of the Nether World. Provide for him the turban rather than (for) its (present) wearer within the secret chamber. (28)''Lo, thou art a great one, the true seed, the soul of a blameless blessed one; thou art one who has control of his hands,'' say they, the Two Comrades, (30)the great and exalted ones, ''(O) Osiris N.'' They rejoice over him, they praise (32)him as (one who is in) their arms. They have given him their magical protection for living. (33)Osiris N. has appeared as the living Soul of Re in the Sky; it has been allotted (35)to him to assume his form. He has been made to triumph in the Council. (36)The gate has been opened for him in sky and earth. (Osiris N., he says: Opened for me is the gate of sky and earth) where the soul of Osiris comes to rest. I have passed through their gate. They rejoice (38)when they see me gone in praised and come out loved. I have (gone on), for no fault of mine has been found and no evil (40)adheres to me. (xcviii) (BD 128) Praising Osiris. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Hail to thee, Osiris Unnofer justified, Son of Nut, thou first Son of Geb, Eldest who came forth (5)from Nut, King over the Abydos nome, presider over the west, lord of Abydos, lord of Souls, Great (7)of Dignity, lord of the atef-crown in Heracleopolis, lord of the Scepter in the Abydos nome, lord of the tomb, (9)great of renown in Mendes, possessor of offerings, numerous of festivals in Mendes. Horus exalts (11)his Father Osiris everywhere, jointly with the divine Isis and her Sister Nephthys. (13)Thoth has said for him the effective spells that are in his belly and go forth from his mouth. The heart of Horus has been preserved (better) than (those of) (15)all the (other) gods. Raise thyself, Horus, Son of Osiris, that thou mayest save thy Father Osiris. O Osiris, (17)I have come unto thee; I am Horus. (I) have saved thee alive on this day when mortuary offerings of bread and (19)beer, oxen and fowl, and all good things go forth for Osiris. (20)Pray raise thyself, Osiris. I smite for thee thy enemies, (I) save thee from them--I am Horus--(22)on this propitious day at the goodly dawning of thy Soul. (23)It exalt(s thee) with itself on this day in thy Council. O Osiris, thy Spirit comes to thee (to be) (25)with thee, that thou mayest be content in this thy Name of Spirit of Contentment. It bless(es thee) in this thy Name (27)of Blessed One. It praises thee in that thy Name of Magician. It opens for thee the goodly ways (29)in this thy Name of Upwawet. O Osiris, I have come to thee. I put for thee thy enemies (beneath thee) (31)everywhere. Thou dost triumph before the Ennead and the Council. O Osiris, take (33)to thee thy mace, thy standard, and thy stairs beneath thee. Thou presentest gifts to the Gods; thou presentest (35)offerings to those who are in their tomb(s). Thou givest thy greatness to the Gods whom thou hast created, (O) great God. Thou shalt be (37)with (them) as (are) their Mummies; thou shalt embrace all the Gods. Thou shalt hear the voice of Truth (39)today. To be said while offering to this God at the wag-feast.

(has) followed and praises the Disk. He has joined the (sun-)praising (baboons); (11)he is one of them. He has been the companion of Isis and the associate of Nephthys; he has made powerful their magic spell(s). He has attached the towrope. (14)He has repulsed his enemy, he has restrained his steps. Re extends his hands to him; his Crew shall not repulse him. (16)If Osiris N. is powerful, the Sound Eye is powerful, and vice versa. To be said over (19)this Image that is sketched, sketched on a new, clean, unused sheet of papyrus with powder of glaze and (21)myrrh-water, placed at a man's breast without its coming (too) close. He embarks in the bark of Re (23)daily, and Thoth looks after him at disembarking and embarking. A truly excellent spell. Thou shalt sketch it in (25)careful outline, likewise the bark of Re. As for the powder of glaze, it is mentioned in order to emphasize the green, (27)this with which the document is to be written. Osiris N. erects the Pillar and sets up (30)the tie-amulet. He sails wherever he will. (31)Gracious is the remark that Thoth made to Re, the sanctuary being content with its Lord Re. Said Thoth: (33)''Look after his Soul at disembarking and embarking in the bark of Re, while the corpse is to remain in its place.'' (c) (BD 130)Roll for initiating the Soul forever and letting it board the bark of Re to pass by the courtiers of the nether world. (1)To be recited on Osiris' birthday.

(4)Open to him, double doors of the Night Bark; open to him, gate(s) of the Day Bark. He inhales Shu; he has created Tefnut. (5)They who are in his train follow him. Osiris N. is (6)Re's follower, one who takes on his character, who provides for his sanctuary like Horus when his fate overtakes him, (7)whose seat is hidden in the ?purity? of his shrine, an envoy of the god to her whom he has loved. Osiris N. has taken (8)(truth); he has offered up her image. He has taken and bound (9)the shrine. He abominates storms; there is no Starry Ho(st) beside him. He has not (been kept away) from Re or Osiris; (10)he has not been warded off by him who accomplishes with his hands. He has not walked in the valley of darkness; he has not entered the lake of the guilty. (11)He is not of those that pour out time; he has not fallen as prey in the place among (those) taken before him (12)around Sopd's slaughtering-place. ?Praise to? you, ?Kneelers?. The God's knife is in concealment; (13)Geb's arms ?become active at? dawn. As for him who is indeed refreshed, he shall lead Older than he and younger in his ((good) time). (14)Now while Thoth is in concealment he (Thoth) has purified (him who takes account of) millions, who opens the sky and dispels cloudiness (15)from about him. (When Osiris N. has reached him) in his seat, he (N.) grasps his staff, he (takes) his scepter, beside Re, (great) (16)(of beautiful goings). The Great One (Re) rises after his eye, (his) Ennead (being around) his seat. They do away with (17)his suffering and his illness when he is sick. Osiris (N.) has done away with his suffering, he refreshes him (N.); illumined for him is the face of Thoth. He praises Re, (and) (19)he (Re) hearkens (to him) and has set up obstacles against his enemies. Osiris N. has not been left boatless, (20)he has not been kept from the Horizon, (for) he is in his knees, for his Name, even Re's name, is in the belly of Osiris (N.) and (22)his dignity is in his mouth. He tells (it) to him, and he hears his words. Praise (be) to thee, Re, lord of the Horizon, Osiris, presider over the westerners. (23)Hail to thee, for whom the sun-folk purify themselves and the Sky brings (offerings) to that great abode past which lead the courses (24)of the rebellious. Behold, Osiris N. is come; he has proclaimed the truth, since {his} marvels are in the west. (25)He has broken the fury of Apophis; he is Ruty. Osiris (N.), he has proclaimed the protection of those who are with him before (26)the great seat. Mayest thou hearken to (him) when Osiris N. enters (27)into the Council. He (drives off) Apophis from Re every day, so that he does not attack him when he wakes. (28)He seizes (the writings); he has received the offerings. He has equipped Thoth with his Eye. He has caused that truth circle about (29)at the prow of the great bark that bears him who is true of speech in the Council. He has established Millions; he has led the courtiers. (30)Osiris N. gives to them a voyage in joy of face. Re's Crew circles about, following (31)his beauty; truth rises high, she circles about her Lord. He (N.) gives praise to the Lord of the Universe. He has taken the staff; (32)he has ?swept? the Sky therewith. The sun-folk give him praise as when rises Horus the unwearying. (33)He exalts Re (by) that which he has done. He has dispelled cloudiness, he has seen his beauty, he has established (34)his course. He circles about, he proceeds to the Bark in the Sky; he shows himself as the sunshine. Osiris N. is the great one in the midst (35)of his eye, sitting (or) kneeling in the great bark of Khepri. He comes into being, and what he says comes into being; he is this (36)which circles the sky toward the west. Verily the Starry Ho(st) rise, while Shu is in rejoicing; they take (37)Re's bow rope from his (crew). As Re circles about, he sees Osiris; entrusted to him is Osiris N. (38)in peace, in peace. He (N.) has not been kept away, he has not been seized, by the scorching breath that is in thy instant. No hindrance has gone forth from thy mouth against him; he has not gone ?with? the crocodile. (39)His abomination is crocodiles; they have not attacked him. He embarks in thy bark; he takes over thy throne. He assumes thy dignity; he follows the paths of Re. (40)His praises shall drive away that noxious one who comes aflame against (thy) Bark (in) this great district. Osiris N., he knows him; (41)he cannot reach thy bark (while) Osiris N. is (therein). It is he who makes offerings to the Gods and mortuary offerings (42)to the blessed. To be said over an image of this initiate put into this bark, after thou hast made the Night Bark at its right side and the Day Bark (43)at its left side. Offer to them bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (other) good things on Osiris' birthday. If this is done for him, (44)his Soul shall stay alive forever. It shall not die again. (This is) a secret of the nether world, a mystery in the god's domain. Found in the Palace of the Great House (45)under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ?Khasety? justified, (as though) found in a mountain cave. (This) is what Horus used (for) his Father Osiris Unnofer justified. Since Re looks upon (46)this blessed one as himself, looks upon him as upon his Ennead, great is the fear of him, great is the esteem of him in the heart(s) of men and Gods and the blessed and the dead. His corpse and (47)his Soul shall live forever; he shall not die again in the god's domain. He shall not be left over on the judgment day; he shall be justified against his enemies. His offerings shall be on (48)the altar of Re daily. (ci) (BD 131)Spell for proceeding to the Sky beside Re. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Re it is who shines this night. As for every man who is in his train, he shall stay alive as a follower (6)of Thoth. He shall give ?the crown? to Horus this night and joy to Osiris, be(8)cause he is one among these while his enemies are well disposed of.","part","N"

(21)(BD 95)Spell for opening beside Thoth. (22)To be said by Osiris N.: (25) It is I who was terror among the raging, who was guardian of the Coil in the conflict.

(23)Just see me, ye Great and powerful gods who preside over the Souls (26)of Heliopolis. I am high above your head(s); I am the beneficent one who is in (29)your heart(s). Behold, I reverence (my) Soul, a Great and powerful one; I have not been given over to (32)that harm that came forth from your mouth(s). (It) is gone; it turned not upon me. (35)I purified myself in the pool for appeasing the judge with the divine fillet under the sycamores (38)of the god's possessions in the sky, while all the previous triumphant ones were refreshing themselves. (41)Arrive, come to me, (hasten), truth, (for mine is) the correct and upright one who is in the earth. I am (the interpreter of his speech), (44)the Might of the sole Lord Re the great, who lives on truth. (46)(Do) no harm (against) me; unveil the day first of all. (lxxi) (BD 98)Spell for bringing the ferry. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Hail to thee, thou district that is in the northern sky in the (6)great lake. He who sees (thee) dies not. I stand upon (thee), appearing (8)as a god. I see (thee, and) I die not as I stand; (10)I live, appearing as a god.

Akhkhew stands firm, (17)supporting the ladder that lets the Unweariable (Stars) ascend exempt from (20)decapitation. I have brought these warders-off of evil as I pass by the waret of Ptah. (24)'' Whence hast thou come (to) Ptah?'' (I have come) from the sea of fire and from the fields of flame. (27)''What dost thou live on in the sea (of) {my} fire and in the fields of flame?'' I live (30)on that august tree. ''O planner, bring to him these ships from ?the twin (33)hair-lakes?--to the well and comfortable one.'' I stand up in the bark and rule (35)the water as a god. I stand, ?trunk{s} and branches?, (when) the traveler embarks. Opened (38)for me are the gates in Letopolis; set aside for me are fields (41)in Hermopolis.

(24)If (this) amulet is applied for him at his throat, (25)he shall be with the Ennead, he shall join the follower(s) of Re. The Starry Host shall be made fast for him (27)in the Sky beside Sothis.

(9)Dung is my abomination; I will not eat it. My ordure, no harm shall come to me therefrom.

(15)It is the night bark and the day bark that bring (them) (to) me. ?Gifts? have been (pro)vided like barley from the altar of the Souls of Heliopolis by (...). (18)?Praise (be)? to thee, Maker of ?Himself? in the turmoil of the sky, vulture that is on high. ?(Even with)? these (dogs) united, (21)I ?advance?. I come in person, (for) this god dwells there.

(12)Overlook thou (this) evil utterance which I have said and this evil wrong (15)which I have committed, without giving (me) over to them, for mine is this natural green papyrus-amulet that is at the throat (18)of Re and is given to the Horizon-Dwellers. If they thrive, I thrive; as they thrive, (21)my Spirit thrives, just as my lifetime thrives, according as they say. The provisions of my spirit are like theirs. (24)(O) thou who weighest (in) the balance, may his Truth rise to the nose of Re by day. (O) my spirit, (27)let not (my) head (be taken away) from (me). (28)(For) mine is an eye that sees, mine are ears that hear. I am not a (30)sacrificial bull; none of me shall become a mortuary offering to those who are over Nut. (lxxvii) (BD 106)Spell for giving offerings in Memphis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Great One, lord of provisions, O Great One presiding over the upper houses, (ye) who give (8)bread to Ptah, give ye me bread, give ye me beer.

O ferryman of Osiris (14)N. in the Field of Rushes, bring (to me) this (19)bread (to) thy (watery) waret as (to) thy Father, the great one who has departed (21)in the god's ship and is gone forth by day after mooring. (24)(BD 107)Spell for going in and out of the gate of the Westerners (among) the followers of Re and knowing the Souls of the west. (28)To be said by Osiris N.: I (31)know that gate in the middle of the Sky from which Re comes forth, the gate of the eastern Horizon of the Sky, (33)south of which are the fields of the khar{em}-geese and north of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place from which Re sails with the stormwind. I am in charge of announcing (36)in the god's ship. (lxxviii)(BD 108)Spell for knowing the Souls of the west. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: As for (4)that mountain of the eastern range on which this Sky rests, it exists in (6)the eastern Horizon of the Sky. It is 370 hundred-cubits long and 240 cubits broad. (8)Sobk, lord of the Eastern Range, is (9)in the east of that mountain. His Temple is of carnelian. (11)On the summit of the mountain is a snake ?30? cubits long and 10 cubits broad, (13)whose first 3 cubits are of flint. I know the name of this snake (who is) on his mountain; (15)He with Searing Breath is his Name. After midday he turns (17)his eyes against Re. Then a stoppage takes place in the bark and great amazement among the sailors. (19)Then he gulps down 7 cubits of the high water. Then Suty pits (himself) against (21)him, he puts his spear of metal at his neck and causes (23)him to disgorge all that he (has) swallowed. To be said over him as a spell: Fall thou back before the (25)sharp metal that is in my hand. I stand against thee, that (27)the bark's course be true. (O) farseer, close for him thy eyes and veil thy head, that (29)he may cross. Fall back before Osiris N., (for) (31)he is a male in his mother's body. Veil thy head and cool thy upper lip, (for if) I stay sound (33)thou stayest sound. I am the great of magic, son of Nut; given to me is this powerful spell (35)against thee. ''What (is it), thou blessed one?'' (O) goer on his belly and his posterior, thou hast no (vertebra). Behold, (37)Osiris N. is gone, (and) thy strength with him. He it is who has taken over thy strength. (40)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God (for) Re. He has set in the evening after traversing this Sky, while thou art in thy bond(s). This is what has been commanded against thee in the presence of (43)Re. Then Re sets in the life-region (in) his Horizon. I know the Souls of the west. They are Atum, Sobk, lord of the eastern (45)range, and Hathor at evening--said of Isis. (lxxix) (BD 109)Spell for knowing the eastern Souls. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I (3)know that eastern gate of the Sky, south of which is the pool of the khar{em}-geese and north (5)of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place whence Re sails with the stormwind. I am (7)in charge of announcing in the god's ship; I am a tireless paddler in the bark of Re. (9)I know that sycamore of turquoise from the midst of which Re comes forth, which grows on the (uplifted) (11)of Shu at every gate through which Re comes forth. (12)I know that Field of Rushes, whose wall is (14)of metal, the height of (whose) barley is 7 cubits, (15)the ears 2 cubits, its stalks 4 cubits, its wheat 7 cubits, (17)the ears 3 cubits. It is a blessed one 7 cubits tall, each of them, who reaps (19)them alongside the eastern Souls. (20)I know the eastern Souls; they are Harakhte, the calf who is in the presence of this god, and the Morning Star. (22)Osiris N. has built the God's city. ''Proceed thou with them,'' says the Filler, (25)he (who) is the plumb of the scalepan. Bull semen is in the midst of thy tongue, (O) ibis who presidest over (living) beings. (27)Thy counsels in the House of the Snare outweigh ?traps? on papyrus, (O) (29)thou who art cool of mouth while advising. Love of thee is with everyone, (thou) being the divine falcon on the (31)left hand, black of face, whose shoulder is likewise (black), (32)who hast ascended to the Sky with the Starry Host, bearing that coffin, and sailest on the paths without transgressing (34)the boundaries of the (fields) of the Gods. (35)''Writings are with thee, as many as (thou) desirest, in the fields of his joy. (And) to start with grain, wheat is there, (nourished) by the efflux (37)of Sesha. The height of its barley is 5 cubits, the ears 1 cubit. Reap for thyself with (39)the blessed alongside the eastern Souls; enter thou freely into the secret portals, (41)(for) thou art pure,'' say they who are in them. ''Reach thy house by magic, gladdening the heart(s) of (43)thy fledglings. To die again is thy abomination; eternity is thine as lifetime, as a present given as a reward.'' (45)Magnified is the eminence of Osiris N., possessor of worthiness. (lxxxi) (BD 110) [This is a series of scenes with captions; see notes.] (lxxxii) (BD 111)Spell for knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)As for that mountain of the Eastern Range on which this Sky rests, (6)Sobk, lord of the eastern range, is in the summit of that mountain of the eastern range yonder. His Temple is of car(nelian). Head (9)to Whom the Mountain (Makes Obeisance) is his name. He is 80 cubits long and 30 cubits broad, while (12)his first 4 cubits are of flint. After midday he turns his eyes against Re. That means the time is at hand, (and there is) (15)great amazement within his bark. Then Seth pits (himself) against him. He says: ''May the course be true.'' Then he says as (18)a spell: ''(O) farseer, close thou thy eyes and veil thy head. If thou stayest sound, I stay sound; (21)it is I who have taken over strength. Given to me is this (powerful spell) against thee. (23)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God on this day at eventide.'' (25)O Osiris N., raise thyself (28)from thy left side, alive, renewed, youthful like (30)Re every day. Thou shalt never, never die. (lxxxiii) (BD 112)Another spell (for) knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(O) Swamp-Dweller in (the city of) Anpet in the Mendesian nome, Trappers yonder (5)in Pe, Eldest Ones who cannot come, Baker of pots, and ye who stir up loaves, know ye, (8)why Pe was given to Horus? I know, but ye know not. It was Re who gave it to him as recompense for (11)the injury to his eyes, on this (wise): Re said to Horus: ''Let me see this that has happened to thy eye.'' As he was examining it, (14)Re said to Horus: ''Pray look at that black pig.'' (16)After he had been looking at it, then the pains in his eye were very violent. (18)Horus said to Re: ''Behold, my eye (feels) as (it did at) that blow which Seth struck (20)at (my) Eye.'' Then he lost consciousness. Re said to these gods: ''Put him on his bed, that he may recover.'' Seth being come, (23)he had assumed his form of black boar. Then he had struck the blow at the eye of Horus. (So) Re said to these gods: (26)''Abominate the pig for Horus' sake, so that he may recover.'' (Thus) came about the great pig-abomination which these Gods, (29)his attendants, proclaimed for Horus' sake when Horus was in his childhood (and his) sacrifices consisted of his beef cattle, his small cattle, and his pigs. As for (32)Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf, Horus is their Father, and Isis is their Mother. (35)Then Horus said to Re: ''Mayest thou give me my Brother in Pe and in Hieraconpolis of my company (to be) with me, (37)he being with (me by) perpetual assignment, that the earth may grow green and turmoil cease.'' (So) originated (39)his name of Horus on His Papyrus. I know the Souls of Pe. They are Horus, (41)Imset, and Hapi. Lift (42)your face(s), (O) gods who are in the nether world, to Osiris N. Behold, he (45)is become a great god. (lxxxiv) (BD 113)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hieraconpolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I know the secrets of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus and this (5)which his mother did concerning him. Said she: ''Pray let there be brought to us Sobk, lord of the farthest waters, that (7)he may fish (them) out.'' When he (had) found (them), his mother restored (them) to their proper place. Then said Sobk, lord of (9)the farthest waters: ''I sought and found (them, but) they kept slipping out from under my fingers (11)at the water's edge. (So) I netted them (12)with a net by main strength.'' That is how the net originated. Re said: ''Well, (14)why (does) Sobk (have) fish and find Horus' {my} hands for him in Fish Land? Say to Sobk: 'Keep secret (17)the secret about this net which brought Horus' (hands) to him. May it be exposed to view (only) on new-crescent day (19)and midmonth day in Fish Land.' '' Then said Re: ''I have given Hieraconpolis to Horus to (be) (21)the seat of his hands. May his (hands) be exposed to view in Hieraconpolis after they have been brought to him, and confine (23)the (genii) that are in them on new-crescent day and midmonth day.'' (24)Horus said: ''Verily Duamutef and (Qebeh)sen(u)f have been given (to) me (to be) with me, (for) they are the ones of my company that I have kept under guard. As for (the time) while I am there, (27)lo, the god of ?the temple? shall be silent.'' Then said Re: ''Put (them) there, even what thou hast given (29)me. Let there be done for them what is done for those who are in Hieraconpolis. So (shall) their corpse(s be) (31)with thee.'' Then Horus said: ''They were with thee, (but) (32)they shall be with me to hear Seth (and) his complaints.'' (Ye) Souls of Hieraconpolis, (34)(blessedness has been) g(iven) to me. I know the Souls of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf. (lxxxv) (BD 114)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hermopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(There is) ?a thrust (wound)? in the shoulder. Neit shines in the stronghold, and the eye ?consumes? him who judges (6)it. I know and have access to it, I know who brought (8)it from Cusae; (but) I will not tell men nor repeat to gods. I have come (10)on Re's errand (to) confirm the truth of the shoulder, (while) Neit shines in the stronghold (12)to inspect it. (I have) come as a mighty one because of knowing the Souls (14)of Hermopolis. The desire for knowledge is your desire. I know the truth, counted, (16)complete, and enduring. Hail to you, (18)Souls of Hermopolis, in accordance with your knowledge. They are Thoth, Perception, (20)and Atum. (lxxxvi) (BD 115)Spell for ascending to the Sky and gaining access to the underworld. Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis.

I know the Souls (8)of Heliopolis (and) him to whom (even) he whose strength is greatest has no access when passing by (and about) the extending of a hand (10)to us. ''I give tongue(s) to the gods,'' says he who would destroy the heir of Heliopolis. (12)I know why a tress is made for a male. It is (because) Re spoke (to) the King of Upper Egypt in his time. Then (15)his mouth was mutilated. That is how the diminution on new-crescent day came about. Said Re (to) him who was in his time: ''Take the 'thirty'-spear, (O) heir (18)of (men).'' That is how the court of the thirty originated through him who was in his time. (So) originated the Brother-Sister Pair, (and) so originated the ?6th-day? feast, (and so) originated (21)?he who hears the (spells written on) bright red linen (bandages)? without staying of his hand. (22)Then he assumed his tressed-woman form. So originated the tressed one of Heliopolis. (25)The Mighty had been bared in this temple{s}. So originated the bared one in Heliopolis. When the heir of his heir comes into being, many are (28)the things he shall see; and he shall become the great of strength, the god, even the son who makes (offerings) to his Father. (30)His portion shall become (that of) the great of strength in Heliopolis. (31)I know the Souls of Heliopolis. They are Re and Shu and Tefnut. (lxxxvii) (BD 116)Spell for knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(Neit) shines in Mata(t), truth has been extracted from the shoulder, and (6)the eye has been eaten by Him Who Counted It. I have access to it by the setem-priest, (but I) will not tell men nor (9)repeat to gods, and vice versa. I intrude not into what I know not; I see not the mysteries. Hail to you, (12)ye gods of Hermopolis. He who is large on new-crescent day (and) (diminished) on midmonth day--that is Thoth (15)the mysterious. (The others) are Perception and Atum.

(I) receive (10)old age in Rosetau; I lead (the gods) through ?the (temple) doors? of Osiris. I am (13)the way, leading to them through the twin abodes of Osiris. (15)(BD 119)Spell for going forth from Rosetau. To be said by (17)Osiris N.: I am (20)the Great One who created his light. I have come unto thee (that I may praise thee) while washing away (23)thy efflux far from thee. (24)I set up my name in Rosetau, my power in Abydos. Pray raise (27)thyself, Osiris, that thou mayest circle this sky with Re, that thou mayest see (29)the common folk. Sole one in the service of Re, lo, he says to thee: (31)''Osiris N. is the mummy of the god.'' (34)What he says comes to pass. He cannot be kept away from thee, Osiris. (36)(BD 120)Spell for going in and out. (37)To be said by Osiris N.: ?Praise (40)to? thee, Re. Behold, now, (things) more mysterious than the nether world: the scepter and that stake of Geb and that balance (41)of Re wherein he weighs truth every day. Behold, I hoe the earth. Mayest thou let me come aged. (lxxxix) (BD 122)Spell for going in af(ter) going out of the god's domain. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Open to me, since thou art become divine through me.

He goes in as (30)a falcon, he goes out as a phoenix. (O) Morning Star, (make) way for him, that he may enter in (33)peace into the goodly west. (34)He belongs to the pool of Osiris. Make way for Osiris N., that (38)he may enter and praise Osiris the lord of life. (xc) (BD 121)Spell for going in after going out.

Dung (is) my abomination; I will not eat it. Ordure, (10)?no? harm (shall come) therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, I will not step on it with (12)the soles of my feet, because my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley (14)of the Inundation. It is the Night Bark and the Day Bark that have brought them to me, (and) I eat (16)beneath the boughs of the tamarisks. I know ?the bearer of the good?, (18)so that (I) shall recite for myself the hymn to the white crown and I shall wear the uraeus. O doorkeeper of (20)the Gladdeners of the Two Lands, even these makers of offerings, mayest thou let me bring (as offering) the daughter of truth, and (22)let (the god) Akhem open to me his arm(s). (23)May the Ennead keep silence (while) the sun-folk speak with Osiris N.

(31)The sunshine is clothing the sky among the gods. My portion is there of the bread of their (mouth(s)), ?(the mouths of) the gods?. I have come unto the Disk, (34)I have ascended unto the Moon. He speaks to me, his Followers the gods speak to me, (36)his sun-folk speak to me. They who are in darkness feel terror before me within the Great Flood beside the dreadful one, (39)(for) lo, I am there with Osiris; his mat is my mat. I tell him the words of men; I (repeat) to him the words of the gods: ''Come to me, (42)(O) equipped blessed one, (for) thou hast caused truth to ascend to (him who loves her).''

Osiris (2)N. (saw) the splitting of the ashed-tree{s} beside him in Rosetau. He is the fodder of the gods, who knows what is in their bellie(s). (4)He has come hither to cause to ascend and to testify to the truth and (to) equilibrate the balance among (5)the Silent Ones. O (god) high on his standard, lord of the atef-crown, who has ?set up? his name as lord (6)of the winds, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from thy Messengers who are over evil and bring about punishment, (8)in whose faces is no pity, because Osiris (N.) has done the truth for the Lord of Truth. He is (9)pure, his heart is pure. His front is clean, his rear is undefiled, his middle is (10)the site of truth. Not one of his members is impure. Osiris N. purifies himself in that (southern) site, (he) rests (in) the (12)northern ?district?, in the field of grasshoppers wherein Uto purifies herself at that (13)4th hour of the night and (at the) 8th hour of the day and (s)oothes the hearts of the gods when (14)they pass by night and by day. ''Let him come,'' say they, the gods, (of) Osiris N. ''Who, pray, (art thou)?'' say they to him. ''What, pray, is thy Name?'' (16)say they. I am Osiris N., the (17)lower growth (of) the papyrus plant; He Who Is in His Moringa Tree is the name (of) Osiris N. ''What (didst) thou pass by?'' say they to him. (I) pass(ed) by ?shrines? (19)north of a moringa tree. ''What, pray, didst thou see (there)?'' A leg and ?a thigh?. ''What, pray, (20)didst thou say to them?'' (I) have seen rejoicing in the lands of the Phoenicians. (21)''And what, pray, did they give thee?'' A firebrand and a block of green fayence. ''What, pray, (22)didst thou do with them?'' I buried (them) on that shore of the (m)aa(t)-lake (23)by night. ''And what, pray, didst thou find on it--that shore of the maa(t)-lake?'' (24)A scepter of flint. ''(Didst) thou take it?'' is asked. ''(Did) Osiris N. take it?'' ''What, pray, is (26)this scepter of flint?'' Breath-Giver is its Name. ''What, pray, didst thou do with {it} the firebrand (27)and the block of green fayence after thou hadst buried (them)?'' Osiris N. (exulted) over them, and he took (them) out. (29)He quenched the fire and he smashed the green block by throwing (them) (into the lake). ''Come thou, enter (30)into the broad hall of the City of the Two Truths, (for) thou know(est us).'' ''I will not let thee enter past me,'' (31)says the jamb of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Plumb Bob (of) the Place of Truth is thy name. (32)''I will not let thee enter past me,'' says the right-hand ?beam? of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Master of the Counting of Hearts is thy name. ''I will not let (35)thee pass by me,'' says the floor (of) this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Pillar of Geb is thy name. (36)''I will not open for thee,'' says the bolt, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' He Whom His Mother ?Announced? is thy name. (37)''I will not open for thee,'' says the ?housing? of the bolt, ''I will not let it (the bolt) go forth,'' says the ?channel? of (38)this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Living Eye of Sobk the Lord of the Eastern Range is thy name. (39)''Thou shalt not open to me, thou shalt not pass me,'' say the double doors, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' (Breast) of Shu when He Presented (40)Himself as Protection of Osiris is thy name. ''We will not let thee pass by us,'' say the rails, ''unless thou tellest (41)our name.'' Brats of Renenutet is your name. ''Thou knowest us; pass on.'' ''Thou shalt not tread upon me,'' (42)says the floor of this broad hall. But why? I am pure. ''Because thou knowest not the name (of) thy feet (43)(with) which thou treadest upon (me).'' I know the name of the feet with which I tread upon thee. ''Then tell me.'' {The seb(44)seb is mine.} Sebseb of Ha is the name of (my) right foot; Wenpet of Nephthys is the name of my (45)left foot. ''Tread thou upon us, for thou knowest us.'' ''(I) will not announce thee,'' says the doorkeeper, ''(un)less thou tellest my name.'' Perceiver (46)of Hearts, Searcher of Bellie(s), is thy name. ''(To) which god on duty shall I announce thee?'' And who, (47)pray, is the god on duty? ''The reckoner of the Two Lands will tell thee.'' And who, pray, is that--the reckoner of the Two Lands? (48)''It is Thoth.'' ''Here I am,'' says Thoth. ''For what purpose hast thou come?'' Osiris N. comes (49)to report. ''What, pray?'' says he to thee. I am pure from (50)all evil deeds. I am aloof from the quarrels of those who are (on duty) in their day; I am not in on them. (51)''(To) whom shall (I) announce thee?'' Announce (me) to (him) whose roof is of fire {of fire}, (52)whose wall is of living cobras, and whose floor is (of) water. ''(Who) is he?'' He is Osiris. ''Proceed, (53)then. Behold, thou art announced. Thy bread is the Sound Eye, thy beer is the Sound Eye; thy mortuary offering is the Sound Eye.'' Triumphant is (54)Osiris N. forever. To be said by (55)a man who is pure, when he has clothed himself in new raiment, is shod with white sandals, is anointed with the finest oil of myrrh, and has presented bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (kinds of) vegetables.

(xcvi) (BD 126)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O ye 4 baboons who sit at the prow of the bark of Re, who cause (6)truth to ascend to the Lord of the Universe, who judge between the needy and the rich, (8)who gladden the gods with the scorching breath of their mouth(s), who give divine offerings (10)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed, who live on truth and sip (12)of truth, who lie not and whose abomination is sin, may (14)ye remove all evil from me, may ye blot out my sins, (for) no foulness (16)attaches to you. May ye let me penetrate the underworld and enter into Rosetau (18) and pass through the (secret) portals of the west. Then shall ye give me a cake and (20)a loaf like these blessed ones who go in and out of Rosetau. (22)Pass; come thou. I have removed thy evil, I have blotted out (24)thy sins. What would harm thee is disposed of; I have done away with the evil that attached to thee. Enter (26)thou into Rosetau. Thou passest through the secret portals of the west; (28)thou goest out and in (at) will like these blessed ones. Thou art summoned every day within (30)the horizon. (xcvii) (BD 127)Roll for praising the cave-gods. Said by a man on reaching them and entering to see this god in the house of the nether world. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Hail to you, cave-gods (3)who are in the west. Hail to you, Doorkeepers of the Gates, (4)who guard this god and report before Osiris. Ye are clever and esteemed; ye annihilate (6)the enemies of Re. Ye (il)lumine and dispel your darkness, (while ye see) your holy one and your Elders. Ye live as he lives; (8)ye call to him who is in his Disk. May ye lead me to your road, that my Soul may enter into your secrets. I am one of you; (10)I inspire terror in Apophis, while ye do away with your (foulness) in the west. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, great god who is in his Disk. (12)Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, Osiris presiding over the west, great god, lord of Abydos. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies in sky and earth, Osiris N., (14)even southerners and northerners, westerners and easterners. He follows Osiris presiding over the westerners; (16)he is praised before him in the valley. He triumphs in the great Council, he triumphs in the nether world, like the Starry Host. The flame (18) of his Soul shall consume the corpses of the dead (who) enter into misfortune and whose wrapping is (that of) the perished. (20)(Ye) who make righteous the Souls of all the blameless blessed and serve the Sacred Land in the house of life, mistress of Souls, (22)according as Re is praised and according as Osiris is praised, may ye guide Osiris N., (24)may ye open for him the gates of the nether world. May the earth open its twin caverns, while ye make (26)him triumph against his enemies. May ye give offerings to Them of the Nether World. Provide for him the turban rather than (for) its (present) wearer within the secret chamber. (28)''Lo, thou art a great one, the true seed, the soul of a blameless blessed one; thou art one who has control of his hands,'' say they, the Two Comrades, (30)the great and exalted ones, ''(O) Osiris N.'' They rejoice over him, they praise (32)him as (one who is in) their arms. They have given him their magical protection for living. (33)Osiris N. has appeared as the living Soul of Re in the Sky; it has been allotted (35)to him to assume his form. He has been made to triumph in the Council. (36)The gate has been opened for him in sky and earth. (Osiris N., he says: Opened for me is the gate of sky and earth) where the soul of Osiris comes to rest. I have passed through their gate. They rejoice (38)when they see me gone in praised and come out loved. I have (gone on), for no fault of mine has been found and no evil (40)adheres to me. (xcviii) (BD 128) Praising Osiris. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Hail to thee, Osiris Unnofer justified, Son of Nut, thou first Son of Geb, Eldest who came forth (5)from Nut, King over the Abydos nome, presider over the west, lord of Abydos, lord of Souls, Great (7)of Dignity, lord of the atef-crown in Heracleopolis, lord of the Scepter in the Abydos nome, lord of the tomb, (9)great of renown in Mendes, possessor of offerings, numerous of festivals in Mendes. Horus exalts (11)his Father Osiris everywhere, jointly with the divine Isis and her Sister Nephthys. (13)Thoth has said for him the effective spells that are in his belly and go forth from his mouth. The heart of Horus has been preserved (better) than (those of) (15)all the (other) gods. Raise thyself, Horus, Son of Osiris, that thou mayest save thy Father Osiris. O Osiris, (17)I have come unto thee; I am Horus. (I) have saved thee alive on this day when mortuary offerings of bread and (19)beer, oxen and fowl, and all good things go forth for Osiris. (20)Pray raise thyself, Osiris. I smite for thee thy enemies, (I) save thee from them--I am Horus--(22)on this propitious day at the goodly dawning of thy Soul. (23)It exalt(s thee) with itself on this day in thy Council. O Osiris, thy Spirit comes to thee (to be) (25)with thee, that thou mayest be content in this thy Name of Spirit of Contentment. It bless(es thee) in this thy Name (27)of Blessed One. It praises thee in that thy Name of Magician. It opens for thee the goodly ways (29)in this thy Name of Upwawet. O Osiris, I have come to thee. I put for thee thy enemies (beneath thee) (31)everywhere. Thou dost triumph before the Ennead and the Council. O Osiris, take (33)to thee thy mace, thy standard, and thy stairs beneath thee. Thou presentest gifts to the Gods; thou presentest (35)offerings to those who are in their tomb(s). Thou givest thy greatness to the Gods whom thou hast created, (O) great God. Thou shalt be (37)with (them) as (are) their Mummies; thou shalt embrace all the Gods. Thou shalt hear the voice of Truth (39)today. To be said while offering to this God at the wag-feast. (xcix) (BD 129)Roll for initiating a man and causing that he embark in the bark of Re and his retinue. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (Osiris N. ferries) the Phoenix to Abydos, (4)Osiris to Mendes. He has opened the cave of the Inundation, he has smoothed the way (6)of the Disk, he has drawn Sokar on his sledge, and he makes powerful the Great One in her instant. (8)Osiris N. (has) followed and praises the Disk. He has joined the (sun-)praising (baboons); (11)he is one of them. He has been the companion of Isis and the associate of Nephthys; he has made powerful their magic spell(s). He has attached the towrope. (14)He has repulsed his enemy, he has restrained his steps. Re extends his hands to him; his Crew shall not repulse him. (16)If Osiris N. is powerful, the Sound Eye is powerful, and vice versa. To be said over (19)this Image that is sketched, sketched on a new, clean, unused sheet of papyrus with powder of glaze and (21)myrrh-water, placed at a man's breast without its coming (too) close. He embarks in the bark of Re (23)daily, and Thoth looks after him at disembarking and embarking. A truly excellent spell. Thou shalt sketch it in (25)careful outline, likewise the bark of Re. As for the powder of glaze, it is mentioned in order to emphasize the green, (27)this with which the document is to be written. Osiris N. erects the Pillar and sets up (30)the tie-amulet. He sails wherever he will. (31)Gracious is the remark that Thoth made to Re, the sanctuary being content with its Lord Re. Said Thoth: (33)''Look after his Soul at disembarking and embarking in the bark of Re, while the corpse is to remain in its place.'' (c) (BD 130)Roll for initiating the Soul forever and letting it board the bark of Re to pass by the courtiers of the nether world. (1)To be recited on Osiris' birthday. To be said by Osiris N.: Open, Sky; open (2)earth. Open to me, southerners; open, northerners; open, westerners; open, easterners. Open, double shrine (3)of Upper Egypt; open, double shrine of Lower Egypt. Open, double doors, open, gate(s), to Re, that he may ascend from the Horizon. (4)Open to him, double doors of the Night Bark; open to him, gate(s) of the Day Bark. He inhales Shu; he has created Tefnut. (5)They who are in his train follow him. Osiris N. is (6)Re's follower, one who takes on his character, who provides for his sanctuary like Horus when his fate overtakes him, (7)whose seat is hidden in the ?purity? of his shrine, an envoy of the god to her whom he has loved. Osiris N. has taken (8)(truth); he has offered up her image. He has taken and bound (9)the shrine. He abominates storms; there is no Starry Ho(st) beside him. He has not (been kept away) from Re or Osiris; (10)he has not been warded off by him who accomplishes with his hands. He has not walked in the valley of darkness; he has not entered the lake of the guilty. (11)He is not of those that pour out time; he has not fallen as prey in the place among (those) taken before him (12)around Sopd's slaughtering-place. ?Praise to? you, ?Kneelers?. The God's knife is in concealment; (13)Geb's arms ?become active at? dawn. As for him who is indeed refreshed, he shall lead Older than he and younger in his ((good) time). (14)Now while Thoth is in concealment he (Thoth) has purified (him who takes account of) millions, who opens the sky and dispels cloudiness (15)from about him. (When Osiris N. has reached him) in his seat, he (N.) grasps his staff, he (takes) his scepter, beside Re, (great) (16)(of beautiful goings). The Great One (Re) rises after his eye, (his) Ennead (being around) his seat. They do away with (17)his suffering and his illness when he is sick. Osiris (N.) has done away with his suffering, he refreshes him (N.); illumined for him is the face of Thoth. He praises Re, (and) (19)he (Re) hearkens (to him) and has set up obstacles against his enemies. Osiris N. has not been left boatless, (20)he has not been kept from the Horizon, (for) he is in his knees, for his Name, even Re's name, is in the belly of Osiris (N.) and (22)his dignity is in his mouth. He tells (it) to him, and he hears his words. Praise (be) to thee, Re, lord of the Horizon, Osiris, presider over the westerners. (23)Hail to thee, for whom the sun-folk purify themselves and the Sky brings (offerings) to that great abode past which lead the courses (24)of the rebellious. Behold, Osiris N. is come; he has proclaimed the truth, since {his} marvels are in the west. (25)He has broken the fury of Apophis; he is Ruty. Osiris (N.), he has proclaimed the protection of those who are with him before (26)the great seat. Mayest thou hearken to (him) when Osiris N. enters (27)into the Council. He (drives off) Apophis from Re every day, so that he does not attack him when he wakes. (28)He seizes (the writings); he has received the offerings. He has equipped Thoth with his Eye. He has caused that truth circle about (29)at the prow of the great bark that bears him who is true of speech in the Council. He has established Millions; he has led the courtiers. (30)Osiris N. gives to them a voyage in joy of face. Re's Crew circles about, following (31)his beauty; truth rises high, she circles about her Lord. He (N.) gives praise to the Lord of the Universe. He has taken the staff; (32)he has ?swept? the Sky therewith. The sun-folk give him praise as when rises Horus the unwearying. (33)He exalts Re (by) that which he has done. He has dispelled cloudiness, he has seen his beauty, he has established (34)his course. He circles about, he proceeds to the Bark in the Sky; he shows himself as the sunshine. Osiris N. is the great one in the midst (35)of his eye, sitting (or) kneeling in the great bark of Khepri. He comes into being, and what he says comes into being; he is this (36)which circles the sky toward the west. Verily the Starry Ho(st) rise, while Shu is in rejoicing; they take (37)Re's bow rope from his (crew). As Re circles about, he sees Osiris; entrusted to him is Osiris N. (38)in peace, in peace. He (N.) has not been kept away, he has not been seized, by the scorching breath that is in thy instant. No hindrance has gone forth from thy mouth against him; he has not gone ?with? the crocodile. (39)His abomination is crocodiles; they have not attacked him. He embarks in thy bark; he takes over thy throne. He assumes thy dignity; he follows the paths of Re. (40)His praises shall drive away that noxious one who comes aflame against (thy) Bark (in) this great district. Osiris N., he knows him; (41)he cannot reach thy bark (while) Osiris N. is (therein). It is he who makes offerings to the Gods and mortuary offerings (42)to the blessed. To be said over an image of this initiate put into this bark, after thou hast made the Night Bark at its right side and the Day Bark (43)at its left side. Offer to them bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (other) good things on Osiris' birthday. If this is done for him, (44)his Soul shall stay alive forever. It shall not die again. (This is) a secret of the nether world, a mystery in the god's domain. Found in the Palace of the Great House (45)under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ?Khasety? justified, (as though) found in a mountain cave. (This) is what Horus used (for) his Father Osiris Unnofer justified. Since Re looks upon (46)this blessed one as himself, looks upon him as upon his Ennead, great is the fear of him, great is the esteem of him in the heart(s) of men and Gods and the blessed and the dead. His corpse and (47)his Soul shall live forever; he shall not die again in the god's domain. He shall not be left over on the judgment day; he shall be justified against his enemies. His offerings shall be on (48)the altar of Re daily. (ci) (BD 131)Spell for proceeding to the Sky beside Re. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Re it is who shines this night. As for every man who is in his train, he shall stay alive as a follower (6)of Thoth. He shall give ?the crown? to Horus this night and joy to Osiris, be(8)cause he is one among these while his enemies are well disposed of.","part","N"

(21)(BD 95)Spell for opening beside Thoth. (22)To be said by Osiris N.: (25) It is I who was terror among the raging, who was guardian of the Coil in the conflict. (28)I smote the violent one, Ash; I cool(ed) Ash off. I acted in behalf of the house of the Great One (in the conflict). (31)I steadied the sharp knife in the hand of Khepri ?among? the raging.

(23)Just see me, ye Great and powerful gods who preside over the Souls (26)of Heliopolis. I am high above your head(s); I am the beneficent one who is in (29)your heart(s). Behold, I reverence (my) Soul, a Great and powerful one; I have not been given over to (32)that harm that came forth from your mouth(s). (It) is gone; it turned not upon me. (35)I purified myself in the pool for appeasing the judge with the divine fillet under the sycamores (38)of the god's possessions in the sky, while all the previous triumphant ones were refreshing themselves. (41)Arrive, come to me, (hasten), truth, (for mine is) the correct and upright one who is in the earth. I am (the interpreter of his speech), (44)the Might of the sole Lord Re the great, who lives on truth. (46)(Do) no harm (against) me; unveil the day first of all. (lxxi) (BD 98)Spell for bringing the ferry. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Hail to thee, thou district that is in the northern sky in the (6)great lake. He who sees (thee) dies not. I stand upon (thee), appearing (8)as a god. I see (thee, and) I die not as I stand; (10)I live, appearing as a god. I honk as a semen-goose; (12)I weep as that falcon over the ?fragrant pate of? the Great One. (15)I cross the earth to the Sky, I stand as Shu.

(24)'' Whence hast thou come (to) Ptah?'' (I have come) from the sea of fire and from the fields of flame. (27)''What dost thou live on in the sea (of) {my} fire and in the fields of flame?'' I live (30)on that august tree. ''O planner, bring to him these ships from ?the twin (33)hair-lakes?--to the well and comfortable one.'' I stand up in the bark and rule (35)the water as a god. I stand, ?trunk{s} and branches?, (when) the traveler embarks. Opened (38)for me are the gates in Letopolis; set aside for me are fields (41)in Hermopolis. Given me is shenes-bread in the presence of the Heir. (lxxii) (BD 99)Spell for bringing the ferryboat in the god's domain.

Thou conductest for me thy journey (6)with these thy attendants who are among the Unweariable (Stars). My abomination is my abomination. I will not eat it. (9)Dung is my abomination; I will not eat it. My ordure, no harm shall come to me therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, (12)I will not step on it with the soles of my feet, because this my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley of the inundation. (15)It is the night bark and the day bark that bring (them) (to) me. ?Gifts? have been (pro)vided like barley from the altar of the Souls of Heliopolis by (...). (18)?Praise (be)? to thee, Maker of ?Himself? in the turmoil of the sky, vulture that is on high. ?(Even with)? these (dogs) united, (21)I ?advance?. I come in person, (for) this god dwells there. Those from which he suffers are these sicknesses. I have come; I have spit on the {my} shank, (24)(I have attached) the {my} upper arm, I have raised the thigh. I embark to sail the Bark. (26)(BD 103)Spell for opening beside Hathor. (27)To be said by Osiris N.: (29)I am a pure departed one, (a aas-?priest?). (30)O Ihy, I shall be beside Hathor. (32)(BD 104)Spell for sitting among the great Gods. (33)To be said by Osiris N.: (35)I sit among the great Gods, having passed by the house of the Night Bark. It is a servant, (36)the porter of Horus the Son of Osiris, who comes to me on Re's errand, (while) food and nourishment are at their appointed place to sup(37)ply offering-cakes to the great Gods. It is a fisher and fowler whom he has brought to me. As for one who knows this spell, (38)he sits among the great Gods. (lxxvi) (BD 105)Spell for making a man's Spirit content in the god's domain. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Hail to thee, my spirit, my lifetime. Behold, I am come (6)unto thee risen, possessed of a soul, powerful, installed. I (have) brought thee bed-natron (9)and incense, (that I may) purify (thee) therewith, that I may purify thy saliva therewith. (12)Overlook thou (this) evil utterance which I have said and this evil wrong (15)which I have committed, without giving (me) over to them, for mine is this natural green papyrus-amulet that is at the throat (18)of Re and is given to the Horizon-Dwellers. If they thrive, I thrive; as they thrive, (21)my Spirit thrives, just as my lifetime thrives, according as they say. The provisions of my spirit are like theirs. (24)(O) thou who weighest (in) the balance, may his Truth rise to the nose of Re by day. (O) my spirit, (27)let not (my) head (be taken away) from (me). (28)(For) mine is an eye that sees, mine are ears that hear. I am not a (30)sacrificial bull; none of me shall become a mortuary offering to those who are over Nut. (lxxvii) (BD 106)Spell for giving offerings in Memphis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Great One, lord of provisions, O Great One presiding over the upper houses, (ye) who give (8)bread to Ptah, give ye me bread, give ye me beer. My breakfast (consists) (11)of a leg (and) pastry. O ferryman of Osiris (14)N. in the Field of Rushes, bring (to me) this (19)bread (to) thy (watery) waret as (to) thy Father, the great one who has departed (21)in the god's ship and is gone forth by day after mooring. (24)(BD 107)Spell for going in and out of the gate of the Westerners (among) the followers of Re and knowing the Souls of the west. (28)To be said by Osiris N.: I (31)know that gate in the middle of the Sky from which Re comes forth, the gate of the eastern Horizon of the Sky, (33)south of which are the fields of the khar{em}-geese and north of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place from which Re sails with the stormwind. I am in charge of announcing (36)in the god's ship. (lxxviii)(BD 108)Spell for knowing the Souls of the west. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: As for (4)that mountain of the eastern range on which this Sky rests, it exists in (6)the eastern Horizon of the Sky. It is 370 hundred-cubits long and 240 cubits broad. (8)Sobk, lord of the Eastern Range, is (9)in the east of that mountain. His Temple is of carnelian. (11)On the summit of the mountain is a snake ?30? cubits long and 10 cubits broad, (13)whose first 3 cubits are of flint. I know the name of this snake (who is) on his mountain; (15)He with Searing Breath is his Name. After midday he turns (17)his eyes against Re. Then a stoppage takes place in the bark and great amazement among the sailors. (19)Then he gulps down 7 cubits of the high water. Then Suty pits (himself) against (21)him, he puts his spear of metal at his neck and causes (23)him to disgorge all that he (has) swallowed. To be said over him as a spell: Fall thou back before the (25)sharp metal that is in my hand. I stand against thee, that (27)the bark's course be true. (O) farseer, close for him thy eyes and veil thy head, that (29)he may cross. Fall back before Osiris N., (for) (31)he is a male in his mother's body. Veil thy head and cool thy upper lip, (for if) I stay sound (33)thou stayest sound. I am the great of magic, son of Nut; given to me is this powerful spell (35)against thee. ''What (is it), thou blessed one?'' (O) goer on his belly and his posterior, thou hast no (vertebra). Behold, (37)Osiris N. is gone, (and) thy strength with him. He it is who has taken over thy strength. (40)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God (for) Re. He has set in the evening after traversing this Sky, while thou art in thy bond(s). This is what has been commanded against thee in the presence of (43)Re. Then Re sets in the life-region (in) his Horizon. I know the Souls of the west. They are Atum, Sobk, lord of the eastern (45)range, and Hathor at evening--said of Isis. (lxxix) (BD 109)Spell for knowing the eastern Souls. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I (3)know that eastern gate of the Sky, south of which is the pool of the khar{em}-geese and north (5)of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place whence Re sails with the stormwind. I am (7)in charge of announcing in the god's ship; I am a tireless paddler in the bark of Re. (9)I know that sycamore of turquoise from the midst of which Re comes forth, which grows on the (uplifted) (11)of Shu at every gate through which Re comes forth. (12)I know that Field of Rushes, whose wall is (14)of metal, the height of (whose) barley is 7 cubits, (15)the ears 2 cubits, its stalks 4 cubits, its wheat 7 cubits, (17)the ears 3 cubits. It is a blessed one 7 cubits tall, each of them, who reaps (19)them alongside the eastern Souls. (20)I know the eastern Souls; they are Harakhte, the calf who is in the presence of this god, and the Morning Star. (22)Osiris N. has built the God's city. ''Proceed thou with them,'' says the Filler, (25)he (who) is the plumb of the scalepan. Bull semen is in the midst of thy tongue, (O) ibis who presidest over (living) beings. (27)Thy counsels in the House of the Snare outweigh ?traps? on papyrus, (O) (29)thou who art cool of mouth while advising. Love of thee is with everyone, (thou) being the divine falcon on the (31)left hand, black of face, whose shoulder is likewise (black), (32)who hast ascended to the Sky with the Starry Host, bearing that coffin, and sailest on the paths without transgressing (34)the boundaries of the (fields) of the Gods. (35)''Writings are with thee, as many as (thou) desirest, in the fields of his joy. (And) to start with grain, wheat is there, (nourished) by the efflux (37)of Sesha. The height of its barley is 5 cubits, the ears 1 cubit. Reap for thyself with (39)the blessed alongside the eastern Souls; enter thou freely into the secret portals, (41)(for) thou art pure,'' say they who are in them. ''Reach thy house by magic, gladdening the heart(s) of (43)thy fledglings. To die again is thy abomination; eternity is thine as lifetime, as a present given as a reward.'' (45)Magnified is the eminence of Osiris N., possessor of worthiness. (lxxxi) (BD 110) [This is a series of scenes with captions; see notes.] (lxxxii) (BD 111)Spell for knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)As for that mountain of the Eastern Range on which this Sky rests, (6)Sobk, lord of the eastern range, is in the summit of that mountain of the eastern range yonder. His Temple is of car(nelian). Head (9)to Whom the Mountain (Makes Obeisance) is his name. He is 80 cubits long and 30 cubits broad, while (12)his first 4 cubits are of flint. After midday he turns his eyes against Re. That means the time is at hand, (and there is) (15)great amazement within his bark. Then Seth pits (himself) against him. He says: ''May the course be true.'' Then he says as (18)a spell: ''(O) farseer, close thou thy eyes and veil thy head. If thou stayest sound, I stay sound; (21)it is I who have taken over strength. Given to me is this (powerful spell) against thee. (23)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God on this day at eventide.'' (25)O Osiris N., raise thyself (28)from thy left side, alive, renewed, youthful like (30)Re every day. Thou shalt never, never die. (lxxxiii) (BD 112)Another spell (for) knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(O) Swamp-Dweller in (the city of) Anpet in the Mendesian nome, Trappers yonder (5)in Pe, Eldest Ones who cannot come, Baker of pots, and ye who stir up loaves, know ye, (8)why Pe was given to Horus? I know, but ye know not. It was Re who gave it to him as recompense for (11)the injury to his eyes, on this (wise): Re said to Horus: ''Let me see this that has happened to thy eye.'' As he was examining it, (14)Re said to Horus: ''Pray look at that black pig.'' (16)After he had been looking at it, then the pains in his eye were very violent. (18)Horus said to Re: ''Behold, my eye (feels) as (it did at) that blow which Seth struck (20)at (my) Eye.'' Then he lost consciousness. Re said to these gods: ''Put him on his bed, that he may recover.'' Seth being come, (23)he had assumed his form of black boar. Then he had struck the blow at the eye of Horus. (So) Re said to these gods: (26)''Abominate the pig for Horus' sake, so that he may recover.'' (Thus) came about the great pig-abomination which these Gods, (29)his attendants, proclaimed for Horus' sake when Horus was in his childhood (and his) sacrifices consisted of his beef cattle, his small cattle, and his pigs. As for (32)Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf, Horus is their Father, and Isis is their Mother. (35)Then Horus said to Re: ''Mayest thou give me my Brother in Pe and in Hieraconpolis of my company (to be) with me, (37)he being with (me by) perpetual assignment, that the earth may grow green and turmoil cease.'' (So) originated (39)his name of Horus on His Papyrus. I know the Souls of Pe. They are Horus, (41)Imset, and Hapi. Lift (42)your face(s), (O) gods who are in the nether world, to Osiris N. Behold, he (45)is become a great god. (lxxxiv) (BD 113)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hieraconpolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I know the secrets of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus and this (5)which his mother did concerning him. Said she: ''Pray let there be brought to us Sobk, lord of the farthest waters, that (7)he may fish (them) out.'' When he (had) found (them), his mother restored (them) to their proper place. Then said Sobk, lord of (9)the farthest waters: ''I sought and found (them, but) they kept slipping out from under my fingers (11)at the water's edge. (So) I netted them (12)with a net by main strength.'' That is how the net originated. Re said: ''Well, (14)why (does) Sobk (have) fish and find Horus' {my} hands for him in Fish Land? Say to Sobk: 'Keep secret (17)the secret about this net which brought Horus' (hands) to him. May it be exposed to view (only) on new-crescent day (19)and midmonth day in Fish Land.' '' Then said Re: ''I have given Hieraconpolis to Horus to (be) (21)the seat of his hands. May his (hands) be exposed to view in Hieraconpolis after they have been brought to him, and confine (23)the (genii) that are in them on new-crescent day and midmonth day.'' (24)Horus said: ''Verily Duamutef and (Qebeh)sen(u)f have been given (to) me (to be) with me, (for) they are the ones of my company that I have kept under guard. As for (the time) while I am there, (27)lo, the god of ?the temple? shall be silent.'' Then said Re: ''Put (them) there, even what thou hast given (29)me. Let there be done for them what is done for those who are in Hieraconpolis. So (shall) their corpse(s be) (31)with thee.'' Then Horus said: ''They were with thee, (but) (32)they shall be with me to hear Seth (and) his complaints.'' (Ye) Souls of Hieraconpolis, (34)(blessedness has been) g(iven) to me. I know the Souls of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf. (lxxxv) (BD 114)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hermopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(There is) ?a thrust (wound)? in the shoulder. Neit shines in the stronghold, and the eye ?consumes? him who judges (6)it. I know and have access to it, I know who brought (8)it from Cusae; (but) I will not tell men nor repeat to gods. I have come (10)on Re's errand (to) confirm the truth of the shoulder, (while) Neit shines in the stronghold (12)to inspect it. (I have) come as a mighty one because of knowing the Souls (14)of Hermopolis. The desire for knowledge is your desire. I know the truth, counted, (16)complete, and enduring. Hail to you, (18)Souls of Hermopolis, in accordance with your knowledge. They are Thoth, Perception, (20)and Atum. (lxxxvi) (BD 115)Spell for ascending to the Sky and gaining access to the underworld. Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis.

Look upon the Eye of the One, (6)?open to (me)? the form of darkness, (for) I am one of you. I know the Souls (8)of Heliopolis (and) him to whom (even) he whose strength is greatest has no access when passing by (and about) the extending of a hand (10)to us. ''I give tongue(s) to the gods,'' says he who would destroy the heir of Heliopolis. (12)I know why a tress is made for a male. It is (because) Re spoke (to) the King of Upper Egypt in his time. Then (15)his mouth was mutilated. That is how the diminution on new-crescent day came about. Said Re (to) him who was in his time: ''Take the 'thirty'-spear, (O) heir (18)of (men).'' That is how the court of the thirty originated through him who was in his time. (So) originated the Brother-Sister Pair, (and) so originated the ?6th-day? feast, (and so) originated (21)?he who hears the (spells written on) bright red linen (bandages)? without staying of his hand. (22)Then he assumed his tressed-woman form. So originated the tressed one of Heliopolis. (25)The Mighty had been bared in this temple{s}. So originated the bared one in Heliopolis. When the heir of his heir comes into being, many are (28)the things he shall see; and he shall become the great of strength, the god, even the son who makes (offerings) to his Father. (30)His portion shall become (that of) the great of strength in Heliopolis. (31)I know the Souls of Heliopolis. They are Re and Shu and Tefnut. (lxxxvii) (BD 116)Spell for knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(Neit) shines in Mata(t), truth has been extracted from the shoulder, and (6)the eye has been eaten by Him Who Counted It. I have access to it by the setem-priest, (but I) will not tell men nor (9)repeat to gods, and vice versa. I intrude not into what I know not; I see not the mysteries. Hail to you, (12)ye gods of Hermopolis. He who is large on new-crescent day (and) (diminished) on midmonth day--that is Thoth (15)the mysterious. (The others) are Perception and Atum. (17)(BD 117)Spell for taking the road in Rosetau. (19)To be said by Osiris N.: The road of my face is (22)toward Rosetau. It is I who clothed the great one with Greatness. I have come, I have come; I have established offerings in Abydos. (25)Open for me the road in Rosetau, (for) I have healed things in Osiris. (27)I am one who created water and assigned (his) throne. Make {my} way for me in the valley (and) in the lake of the Great One. Make (30)way for me, ?(for) thine and his am I?. (lxxxviii) (BD 118)Spell for reaching Rosetau.

(I) receive (10)old age in Rosetau; I lead (the gods) through ?the (temple) doors? of Osiris. I am (13)the way, leading to them through the twin abodes of Osiris. (15)(BD 119)Spell for going forth from Rosetau. To be said by (17)Osiris N.: I am (20)the Great One who created his light. I have come unto thee (that I may praise thee) while washing away (23)thy efflux far from thee. (24)I set up my name in Rosetau, my power in Abydos. Pray raise (27)thyself, Osiris, that thou mayest circle this sky with Re, that thou mayest see (29)the common folk. Sole one in the service of Re, lo, he says to thee: (31)''Osiris N. is the mummy of the god.'' (34)What he says comes to pass. He cannot be kept away from thee, Osiris. (36)(BD 120)Spell for going in and out. (37)To be said by Osiris N.: ?Praise (40)to? thee, Re. Behold, now, (things) more mysterious than the nether world: the scepter and that stake of Geb and that balance (41)of Re wherein he weighs truth every day. Behold, I hoe the earth. Mayest thou let me come aged. (lxxxix) (BD 122)Spell for going in af(ter) going out of the god's domain. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)Open to me, since thou art become divine through me.

Toward him who is intimately associated with the mes(12)qet-region. He will let me cross ?by? bark to the seat of him who recognizes faces. (14)Assembler of Souls is the name of the ferryman. Hair-Comber is the name of (17)its oars; (Wide) Awake is the name of its bow rope. Evil Are They is the name of (19)its ?dipper?; Dependable (and) Accurate is the name of its steering oar.

He goes in as (30)a falcon, he goes out as a phoenix. (O) Morning Star, (make) way for him, that he may enter in (33)peace into the goodly west. (34)He belongs to the pool of Osiris.

Dung (is) my abomination; I will not eat it. Ordure, (10)?no? harm (shall come) therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, I will not step on it with (12)the soles of my feet, because my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley (14)of the Inundation. It is the Night Bark and the Day Bark that have brought them to me, (and) I eat (16)beneath the boughs of the tamarisks. I know ?the bearer of the good?, (18)so that (I) shall recite for myself the hymn to the white crown and I shall wear the uraeus.

(32)O ?Carrier-off of His Portion? who came forth from the god's domain, I have not insulted the God in my heart--variant: in my face. (33)Hail to you, ye gods. I know your name(s). I shall not fall to (your) sword(s). (34)(Ye) shall not report my (wickedness) to that god in whose train (ye) are. No affair of mine shall come before you. (35)May ye tell the Truth for me before the Lord of the Universe, because I have done what was right in Egypt. (36)I have not reviled the God. No affair (of mine) has come before the King (who was) in his day. To be said by Osiris N.: Hail to you, gods (38)who are in the broad hall of the Two Truths, in whose bellie(s) is no falsehood, who live on (39)truth in Heliopolis and swallow (it) in their heart(s) in the presence of Horus who is in his Disk. May (40)ye rescue me from Baby, who lives on the entrails of the Elders, on that day of the great accounting. Behold Osiris N. (42)is come unto you. He is without sin, he is without (guilt), he is without evil, (43)he is without a witness. Nothing shall be done against him. He lives on truth, he sips of truth. (44)He has been joyous of heart; he (has) done what men request and what the gods (are pleased) with. He has gladdened the god (45)with his desire. He has provided bread for the hungry, water for the thirsty, clothing for (46)the naked. He has given (use of) a ferryboat (to) the boatless. He has given offerings (47)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed. May ye indeed rescue him, may (48)ye indeed protect him {because}. Ye shall not complain against him before the lord of mummies, (49)for his mouth is clean and his hands are clean (and he is one) (to whom is said) ''Welcome, welcome, in peace,'' (50)(b)y those who see him, because Osiris N. hear(d) (51)that important conversation which the ass held with the cat in the house of the Open- (xciv) (1)mouthed One. ?He testifies (that)? when he looked behind him he uttered a cry. Osiris (2)N. (saw) the splitting of the ashed-tree{s} beside him in Rosetau. He is the fodder of the gods, who knows what is in their bellie(s). (4)He has come hither to cause to ascend and to testify to the truth and (to) equilibrate the balance among (5)the Silent Ones. O (god) high on his standard, lord of the atef-crown, who has ?set up? his name as lord (6)of the winds, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from thy Messengers who are over evil and bring about punishment, (8)in whose faces is no pity, because Osiris (N.) has done the truth for the Lord of Truth. He is (9)pure, his heart is pure. His front is clean, his rear is undefiled, his middle is (10)the site of truth. Not one of his members is impure. Osiris N. purifies himself in that (southern) site, (he) rests (in) the (12)northern ?district?, in the field of grasshoppers wherein Uto purifies herself at that (13)4th hour of the night and (at the) 8th hour of the day and (s)oothes the hearts of the gods when (14)they pass by night and by day. ''Let him come,'' say they, the gods, (of) Osiris N. ''Who, pray, (art thou)?'' say they to him. ''What, pray, is thy Name?'' (16)say they. I am Osiris N., the (17)lower growth (of) the papyrus plant; He Who Is in His Moringa Tree is the name (of) Osiris N. ''What (didst) thou pass by?'' say they to him. (I) pass(ed) by ?shrines? (19)north of a moringa tree. ''What, pray, didst thou see (there)?'' A leg and ?a thigh?. ''What, pray, (20)didst thou say to them?'' (I) have seen rejoicing in the lands of the Phoenicians. (21)''And what, pray, did they give thee?'' A firebrand and a block of green fayence. ''What, pray, (22)didst thou do with them?'' I buried (them) on that shore of the (m)aa(t)-lake (23)by night. ''And what, pray, didst thou find on it--that shore of the maa(t)-lake?'' (24)A scepter of flint. ''(Didst) thou take it?'' is asked. ''(Did) Osiris N. take it?'' ''What, pray, is (26)this scepter of flint?'' Breath-Giver is its Name. ''What, pray, didst thou do with {it} the firebrand (27)and the block of green fayence after thou hadst buried (them)?'' Osiris N. (exulted) over them, and he took (them) out. (29)He quenched the fire and he smashed the green block by throwing (them) (into the lake). ''Come thou, enter (30)into the broad hall of the City of the Two Truths, (for) thou know(est us).'' ''I will not let thee enter past me,'' (31)says the jamb of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Plumb Bob (of) the Place of Truth is thy name. (32)''I will not let thee enter past me,'' says the right-hand ?beam? of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Master of the Counting of Hearts is thy name. ''I will not let (35)thee pass by me,'' says the floor (of) this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Pillar of Geb is thy name. (36)''I will not open for thee,'' says the bolt, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' He Whom His Mother ?Announced? is thy name. (37)''I will not open for thee,'' says the ?housing? of the bolt, ''I will not let it (the bolt) go forth,'' says the ?channel? of (38)this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Living Eye of Sobk the Lord of the Eastern Range is thy name. (39)''Thou shalt not open to me, thou shalt not pass me,'' say the double doors, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' (Breast) of Shu when He Presented (40)Himself as Protection of Osiris is thy name. ''We will not let thee pass by us,'' say the rails, ''unless thou tellest (41)our name.'' Brats of Renenutet is your name. ''Thou knowest us; pass on.'' ''Thou shalt not tread upon me,'' (42)says the floor of this broad hall. But why? I am pure. ''Because thou knowest not the name (of) thy feet (43)(with) which thou treadest upon (me).'' I know the name of the feet with which I tread upon thee. ''Then tell me.'' {The seb(44)seb is mine.} Sebseb of Ha is the name of (my) right foot; Wenpet of Nephthys is the name of my (45)left foot. ''Tread thou upon us, for thou knowest us.'' ''(I) will not announce thee,'' says the doorkeeper, ''(un)less thou tellest my name.'' Perceiver (46)of Hearts, Searcher of Bellie(s), is thy name. ''(To) which god on duty shall I announce thee?'' And who, (47)pray, is the god on duty? ''The reckoner of the Two Lands will tell thee.'' And who, pray, is that--the reckoner of the Two Lands? (48)''It is Thoth.'' ''Here I am,'' says Thoth. ''For what purpose hast thou come?'' Osiris N. comes (49)to report. ''What, pray?'' says he to thee. I am pure from (50)all evil deeds. I am aloof from the quarrels of those who are (on duty) in their day; I am not in on them. (51)''(To) whom shall (I) announce thee?'' Announce (me) to (him) whose roof is of fire {of fire}, (52)whose wall is of living cobras, and whose floor is (of) water. ''(Who) is he?'' He is Osiris. ''Proceed, (53)then. Behold, thou art announced. Thy bread is the Sound Eye, thy beer is the Sound Eye; thy mortuary offering is the Sound Eye.'' Triumphant is (54)Osiris N. forever. To be said by (55)a man who is pure, when he has clothed himself in new raiment, is shod with white sandals, is anointed with the finest oil of myrrh, and has presented bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (kinds of) vegetables. Lo, copy for thyself this (text) in writing on a (56)clean ground with Nubian pigment overlaid with soil on which no small cattle have trodden. If this roll is used in his behalf, he shall continue to thrive as (shall) his children's children, (for) he is guiltless. He shall be an intimate of the King (and) his courtiers. There shall be given (57)him a cake, a loaf, milk, and a chunk of meat from the altar of the great god. He shall not be kept away from any gate of the west{erners}. He shall be drawn with the Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. He shall be in the retinue (of) Osiris. A truly excellent spell (proved) a million times. (xcv) (Over deceased:) (1)To be said by Osiris (N.). (Over Truth:) (2)Truth, mistress of the west. May she cause that his (name) be in his temple, (5)associated (with) his eternal tomb.

(xcvi) (BD 126)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O ye 4 baboons who sit at the prow of the bark of Re, who cause (6)truth to ascend to the Lord of the Universe, who judge between the needy and the rich, (8)who gladden the gods with the scorching breath of their mouth(s), who give divine offerings (10)to the gods and mortuary offerings to the blessed, who live on truth and sip (12)of truth, who lie not and whose abomination is sin, may (14)ye remove all evil from me, may ye blot out my sins, (for) no foulness (16)attaches to you. May ye let me penetrate the underworld and enter into Rosetau (18) and pass through the (secret) portals of the west. Then shall ye give me a cake and (20)a loaf like these blessed ones who go in and out of Rosetau. (22)Pass; come thou. I have removed thy evil, I have blotted out (24)thy sins. What would harm thee is disposed of; I have done away with the evil that attached to thee. Enter (26)thou into Rosetau. Thou passest through the secret portals of the west; (28)thou goest out and in (at) will like these blessed ones. Thou art summoned every day within (30)the horizon. (xcvii) (BD 127)Roll for praising the cave-gods. Said by a man on reaching them and entering to see this god in the house of the nether world. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Hail to you, cave-gods (3)who are in the west. Hail to you, Doorkeepers of the Gates, (4)who guard this god and report before Osiris. Ye are clever and esteemed; ye annihilate (6)the enemies of Re. Ye (il)lumine and dispel your darkness, (while ye see) your holy one and your Elders. Ye live as he lives; (8)ye call to him who is in his Disk. May ye lead me to your road, that my Soul may enter into your secrets. I am one of you; (10)I inspire terror in Apophis, while ye do away with your (foulness) in the west. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, great god who is in his Disk. (12)Thou art triumphant against thy enemies, Osiris presiding over the west, great god, lord of Abydos. Thou art triumphant against thy enemies in sky and earth, Osiris N., (14)even southerners and northerners, westerners and easterners. He follows Osiris presiding over the westerners; (16)he is praised before him in the valley. He triumphs in the great Council, he triumphs in the nether world, like the Starry Host. The flame (18) of his Soul shall consume the corpses of the dead (who) enter into misfortune and whose wrapping is (that of) the perished. (20)(Ye) who make righteous the Souls of all the blameless blessed and serve the Sacred Land in the house of life, mistress of Souls, (22)according as Re is praised and according as Osiris is praised, may ye guide Osiris N., (24)may ye open for him the gates of the nether world. May the earth open its twin caverns, while ye make (26)him triumph against his enemies. May ye give offerings to Them of the Nether World. Provide for him the turban rather than (for) its (present) wearer within the secret chamber. (28)''Lo, thou art a great one, the true seed, the soul of a blameless blessed one; thou art one who has control of his hands,'' say they, the Two Comrades, (30)the great and exalted ones, ''(O) Osiris N.'' They rejoice over him, they praise (32)him as (one who is in) their arms. They have given him their magical protection for living. (33)Osiris N. has appeared as the living Soul of Re in the Sky; it has been allotted (35)to him to assume his form. He has been made to triumph in the Council. (36)The gate has been opened for him in sky and earth. (Osiris N., he says: Opened for me is the gate of sky and earth) where the soul of Osiris comes to rest. I have passed through their gate. They rejoice (38)when they see me gone in praised and come out loved. I have (gone on), for no fault of mine has been found and no evil (40)adheres to me. (xcviii) (BD 128) Praising Osiris. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Hail to thee, Osiris Unnofer justified, Son of Nut, thou first Son of Geb, Eldest who came forth (5)from Nut, King over the Abydos nome, presider over the west, lord of Abydos, lord of Souls, Great (7)of Dignity, lord of the atef-crown in Heracleopolis, lord of the Scepter in the Abydos nome, lord of the tomb, (9)great of renown in Mendes, possessor of offerings, numerous of festivals in Mendes. Horus exalts (11)his Father Osiris everywhere, jointly with the divine Isis and her Sister Nephthys. (13)Thoth has said for him the effective spells that are in his belly and go forth from his mouth. The heart of Horus has been preserved (better) than (those of) (15)all the (other) gods. Raise thyself, Horus, Son of Osiris, that thou mayest save thy Father Osiris. O Osiris, (17)I have come unto thee; I am Horus. (I) have saved thee alive on this day when mortuary offerings of bread and (19)beer, oxen and fowl, and all good things go forth for Osiris. (20)Pray raise thyself, Osiris. I smite for thee thy enemies, (I) save thee from them--I am Horus--(22)on this propitious day at the goodly dawning of thy Soul. (23)It exalt(s thee) with itself on this day in thy Council. O Osiris, thy Spirit comes to thee (to be) (25)with thee, that thou mayest be content in this thy Name of Spirit of Contentment. It bless(es thee) in this thy Name (27)of Blessed One. It praises thee in that thy Name of Magician. It opens for thee the goodly ways (29)in this thy Name of Upwawet. O Osiris, I have come to thee. I put for thee thy enemies (beneath thee) (31)everywhere. Thou dost triumph before the Ennead and the Council. O Osiris, take (33)to thee thy mace, thy standard, and thy stairs beneath thee. Thou presentest gifts to the Gods; thou presentest (35)offerings to those who are in their tomb(s). Thou givest thy greatness to the Gods whom thou hast created, (O) great God. Thou shalt be (37)with (them) as (are) their Mummies; thou shalt embrace all the Gods. Thou shalt hear the voice of Truth (39)today. To be said while offering to this God at the wag-feast. (xcix) (BD 129)Roll for initiating a man and causing that he embark in the bark of Re and his retinue. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (Osiris N. ferries) the Phoenix to Abydos, (4)Osiris to Mendes. He has opened the cave of the Inundation, he has smoothed the way (6)of the Disk, he has drawn Sokar on his sledge, and he makes powerful the Great One in her instant. (8)Osiris N. (has) followed and praises the Disk. He has joined the (sun-)praising (baboons); (11)he is one of them. He has been the companion of Isis and the associate of Nephthys; he has made powerful their magic spell(s). He has attached the towrope. (14)He has repulsed his enemy, he has restrained his steps. Re extends his hands to him; his Crew shall not repulse him. (16)If Osiris N. is powerful, the Sound Eye is powerful, and vice versa. To be said over (19)this Image that is sketched, sketched on a new, clean, unused sheet of papyrus with powder of glaze and (21)myrrh-water, placed at a man's breast without its coming (too) close. He embarks in the bark of Re (23)daily, and Thoth looks after him at disembarking and embarking. A truly excellent spell. Thou shalt sketch it in (25)careful outline, likewise the bark of Re. As for the powder of glaze, it is mentioned in order to emphasize the green, (27)this with which the document is to be written. Osiris N. erects the Pillar and sets up (30)the tie-amulet. He sails wherever he will. (31)Gracious is the remark that Thoth made to Re, the sanctuary being content with its Lord Re. Said Thoth: (33)''Look after his Soul at disembarking and embarking in the bark of Re, while the corpse is to remain in its place.'' (c) (BD 130)Roll for initiating the Soul forever and letting it board the bark of Re to pass by the courtiers of the nether world. (1)To be recited on Osiris' birthday. To be said by Osiris N.: Open, Sky; open (2)earth. Open to me, southerners; open, northerners; open, westerners; open, easterners. Open, double shrine (3)of Upper Egypt; open, double shrine of Lower Egypt. Open, double doors, open, gate(s), to Re, that he may ascend from the Horizon. (4)Open to him, double doors of the Night Bark; open to him, gate(s) of the Day Bark. He inhales Shu; he has created Tefnut. (5)They who are in his train follow him. Osiris N. is (6)Re's follower, one who takes on his character, who provides for his sanctuary like Horus when his fate overtakes him, (7)whose seat is hidden in the ?purity? of his shrine, an envoy of the god to her whom he has loved. Osiris N. has taken (8)(truth); he has offered up her image. He has taken and bound (9)the shrine. He abominates storms; there is no Starry Ho(st) beside him. He has not (been kept away) from Re or Osiris; (10)he has not been warded off by him who accomplishes with his hands. He has not walked in the valley of darkness; he has not entered the lake of the guilty. (11)He is not of those that pour out time; he has not fallen as prey in the place among (those) taken before him (12)around Sopd's slaughtering-place. ?Praise to? you, ?Kneelers?. The God's knife is in concealment; (13)Geb's arms ?become active at? dawn. As for him who is indeed refreshed, he shall lead Older than he and younger in his ((good) time). (14)Now while Thoth is in concealment he (Thoth) has purified (him who takes account of) millions, who opens the sky and dispels cloudiness (15)from about him. (When Osiris N. has reached him) in his seat, he (N.) grasps his staff, he (takes) his scepter, beside Re, (great) (16)(of beautiful goings). The Great One (Re) rises after his eye, (his) Ennead (being around) his seat. They do away with (17)his suffering and his illness when he is sick. Osiris (N.) has done away with his suffering, he refreshes him (N.); illumined for him is the face of Thoth. He praises Re, (and) (19)he (Re) hearkens (to him) and has set up obstacles against his enemies. Osiris N. has not been left boatless, (20)he has not been kept from the Horizon, (for) he is in his knees, for his Name, even Re's name, is in the belly of Osiris (N.) and (22)his dignity is in his mouth. He tells (it) to him, and he hears his words. Praise (be) to thee, Re, lord of the Horizon, Osiris, presider over the westerners. (23)Hail to thee, for whom the sun-folk purify themselves and the Sky brings (offerings) to that great abode past which lead the courses (24)of the rebellious. Behold, Osiris N. is come; he has proclaimed the truth, since {his} marvels are in the west. (25)He has broken the fury of Apophis; he is Ruty. Osiris (N.), he has proclaimed the protection of those who are with him before (26)the great seat. Mayest thou hearken to (him) when Osiris N. enters (27)into the Council. He (drives off) Apophis from Re every day, so that he does not attack him when he wakes. (28)He seizes (the writings); he has received the offerings. He has equipped Thoth with his Eye. He has caused that truth circle about (29)at the prow of the great bark that bears him who is true of speech in the Council. He has established Millions; he has led the courtiers. (30)Osiris N. gives to them a voyage in joy of face. Re's Crew circles about, following (31)his beauty; truth rises high, she circles about her Lord. He (N.) gives praise to the Lord of the Universe. He has taken the staff; (32)he has ?swept? the Sky therewith. The sun-folk give him praise as when rises Horus the unwearying. (33)He exalts Re (by) that which he has done. He has dispelled cloudiness, he has seen his beauty, he has established (34)his course. He circles about, he proceeds to the Bark in the Sky; he shows himself as the sunshine. Osiris N. is the great one in the midst (35)of his eye, sitting (or) kneeling in the great bark of Khepri. He comes into being, and what he says comes into being; he is this (36)which circles the sky toward the west. Verily the Starry Ho(st) rise, while Shu is in rejoicing; they take (37)Re's bow rope from his (crew). As Re circles about, he sees Osiris; entrusted to him is Osiris N. (38)in peace, in peace. He (N.) has not been kept away, he has not been seized, by the scorching breath that is in thy instant. No hindrance has gone forth from thy mouth against him; he has not gone ?with? the crocodile. (39)His abomination is crocodiles; they have not attacked him. He embarks in thy bark; he takes over thy throne. He assumes thy dignity; he follows the paths of Re. (40)His praises shall drive away that noxious one who comes aflame against (thy) Bark (in) this great district. Osiris N., he knows him; (41)he cannot reach thy bark (while) Osiris N. is (therein). It is he who makes offerings to the Gods and mortuary offerings (42)to the blessed. To be said over an image of this initiate put into this bark, after thou hast made the Night Bark at its right side and the Day Bark (43)at its left side. Offer to them bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (other) good things on Osiris' birthday. If this is done for him, (44)his Soul shall stay alive forever. It shall not die again. (This is) a secret of the nether world, a mystery in the god's domain. Found in the Palace of the Great House (45)under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ?Khasety? justified, (as though) found in a mountain cave. (This) is what Horus used (for) his Father Osiris Unnofer justified. Since Re looks upon (46)this blessed one as himself, looks upon him as upon his Ennead, great is the fear of him, great is the esteem of him in the heart(s) of men and Gods and the blessed and the dead. His corpse and (47)his Soul shall live forever; he shall not die again in the god's domain. He shall not be left over on the judgment day; he shall be justified against his enemies. His offerings shall be on (48)the altar of Re daily. (ci) (BD 131)Spell for proceeding to the Sky beside Re. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Re it is who shines this night. As for every man who is in his train, he shall stay alive as a follower (6)of Thoth. He shall give ?the crown? to Horus this night and joy to Osiris, be(8)cause he is one among these while his enemies are well disposed of.","part","N"

(1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O Great One in his Bark, thou hast brought thy Bark, that I may sail upstream to thy ?staircase?.

(9)Dung is my abomination; I will not eat it. My ordure, no harm shall come to me therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, (12)I will not step on it with the soles of my feet, because this my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley of the inundation. (15)It is the night bark and the day bark that bring (them) (to) me. ?Gifts? have been (pro)vided like barley from the altar of the Souls of Heliopolis by (...).

(12)Overlook thou (this) evil utterance which I have said and this evil wrong (15)which I have committed, without giving (me) over to them, for mine is this natural green papyrus-amulet that is at the throat (18)of Re and is given to the Horizon-Dwellers. If they thrive, I thrive; as they thrive, (21)my Spirit thrives, just as my lifetime thrives, according as they say. The provisions of my spirit are like theirs. (24)(O) thou who weighest (in) the balance, may his Truth rise to the nose of Re by day. (O) my spirit, (27)let not (my) head (be taken away) from (me). (28)(For) mine is an eye that sees, mine are ears that hear. I am not a (30)sacrificial bull; none of me shall become a mortuary offering to those who are over Nut. (lxxvii) (BD 106)Spell for giving offerings in Memphis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Great One, lord of provisions, O Great One presiding over the upper houses, (ye) who give (8)bread to Ptah, give ye me bread, give ye me beer.

(28)To be said by Osiris N.: I (31)know that gate in the middle of the Sky from which Re comes forth, the gate of the eastern Horizon of the Sky, (33)south of which are the fields of the khar{em}-geese and north of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place from which Re sails with the stormwind. I am in charge of announcing (36)in the god's ship. (lxxviii)(BD 108)Spell for knowing the Souls of the west. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: As for (4)that mountain of the eastern range on which this Sky rests, it exists in (6)the eastern Horizon of the Sky. It is 370 hundred-cubits long and 240 cubits broad. (8)Sobk, lord of the Eastern Range, is (9)in the east of that mountain. His Temple is of carnelian. (11)On the summit of the mountain is a snake ?30? cubits long and 10 cubits broad, (13)whose first 3 cubits are of flint. I know the name of this snake (who is) on his mountain; (15)He with Searing Breath is his Name. After midday he turns (17)his eyes against Re. Then a stoppage takes place in the bark and great amazement among the sailors. (19)Then he gulps down 7 cubits of the high water. Then Suty pits (himself) against (21)him, he puts his spear of metal at his neck and causes (23)him to disgorge all that he (has) swallowed. To be said over him as a spell: Fall thou back before the (25)sharp metal that is in my hand. I stand against thee, that (27)the bark's course be true. (O) farseer, close for him thy eyes and veil thy head, that (29)he may cross. Fall back before Osiris N., (for) (31)he is a male in his mother's body. Veil thy head and cool thy upper lip, (for if) I stay sound (33)thou stayest sound. I am the great of magic, son of Nut; given to me is this powerful spell (35)against thee. ''What (is it), thou blessed one?'' (O) goer on his belly and his posterior, thou hast no (vertebra). Behold, (37)Osiris N. is gone, (and) thy strength with him. He it is who has taken over thy strength. (40)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God (for) Re. He has set in the evening after traversing this Sky, while thou art in thy bond(s). This is what has been commanded against thee in the presence of (43)Re. Then Re sets in the life-region (in) his Horizon. I know the Souls of the west. They are Atum, Sobk, lord of the eastern (45)range, and Hathor at evening--said of Isis. (lxxix) (BD 109)Spell for knowing the eastern Souls. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I (3)know that eastern gate of the Sky, south of which is the pool of the khar{em}-geese and north (5)of which is the water of the ra-geese, even the place whence Re sails with the stormwind. I am (7)in charge of announcing in the god's ship; I am a tireless paddler in the bark of Re. (9)I know that sycamore of turquoise from the midst of which Re comes forth, which grows on the (uplifted) (11)of Shu at every gate through which Re comes forth. (12)I know that Field of Rushes, whose wall is (14)of metal, the height of (whose) barley is 7 cubits, (15)the ears 2 cubits, its stalks 4 cubits, its wheat 7 cubits, (17)the ears 3 cubits. It is a blessed one 7 cubits tall, each of them, who reaps (19)them alongside the eastern Souls. (20)I know the eastern Souls; they are Harakhte, the calf who is in the presence of this god, and the Morning Star. (22)Osiris N. has built the God's city. ''Proceed thou with them,'' says the Filler, (25)he (who) is the plumb of the scalepan. Bull semen is in the midst of thy tongue, (O) ibis who presidest over (living) beings. (27)Thy counsels in the House of the Snare outweigh ?traps? on papyrus, (O) (29)thou who art cool of mouth while advising. Love of thee is with everyone, (thou) being the divine falcon on the (31)left hand, black of face, whose shoulder is likewise (black), (32)who hast ascended to the Sky with the Starry Host, bearing that coffin, and sailest on the paths without transgressing (34)the boundaries of the (fields) of the Gods. (35)''Writings are with thee, as many as (thou) desirest, in the fields of his joy. (And) to start with grain, wheat is there, (nourished) by the efflux (37)of Sesha. The height of its barley is 5 cubits, the ears 1 cubit. Reap for thyself with (39)the blessed alongside the eastern Souls; enter thou freely into the secret portals, (41)(for) thou art pure,'' say they who are in them. ''Reach thy house by magic, gladdening the heart(s) of (43)thy fledglings. To die again is thy abomination; eternity is thine as lifetime, as a present given as a reward.'' (45)Magnified is the eminence of Osiris N., possessor of worthiness. (lxxxi) (BD 110) [This is a series of scenes with captions; see notes.] (lxxxii) (BD 111)Spell for knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)As for that mountain of the Eastern Range on which this Sky rests, (6)Sobk, lord of the eastern range, is in the summit of that mountain of the eastern range yonder. His Temple is of car(nelian). Head (9)to Whom the Mountain (Makes Obeisance) is his name. He is 80 cubits long and 30 cubits broad, while (12)his first 4 cubits are of flint. After midday he turns his eyes against Re. That means the time is at hand, (and there is) (15)great amazement within his bark. Then Seth pits (himself) against him. He says: ''May the course be true.'' Then he says as (18)a spell: ''(O) farseer, close thou thy eyes and veil thy head. If thou stayest sound, I stay sound; (21)it is I who have taken over strength. Given to me is this (powerful spell) against thee. (23)I have come, I have disposed of the Earth-God on this day at eventide.'' (25)O Osiris N., raise thyself (28)from thy left side, alive, renewed, youthful like (30)Re every day. Thou shalt never, never die. (lxxxiii) (BD 112)Another spell (for) knowing the Souls of Pe. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(O) Swamp-Dweller in (the city of) Anpet in the Mendesian nome, Trappers yonder (5)in Pe, Eldest Ones who cannot come, Baker of pots, and ye who stir up loaves, know ye, (8)why Pe was given to Horus? I know, but ye know not. It was Re who gave it to him as recompense for (11)the injury to his eyes, on this (wise): Re said to Horus: ''Let me see this that has happened to thy eye.'' As he was examining it, (14)Re said to Horus: ''Pray look at that black pig.'' (16)After he had been looking at it, then the pains in his eye were very violent. (18)Horus said to Re: ''Behold, my eye (feels) as (it did at) that blow which Seth struck (20)at (my) Eye.'' Then he lost consciousness. Re said to these gods: ''Put him on his bed, that he may recover.'' Seth being come, (23)he had assumed his form of black boar. Then he had struck the blow at the eye of Horus. (So) Re said to these gods: (26)''Abominate the pig for Horus' sake, so that he may recover.'' (Thus) came about the great pig-abomination which these Gods, (29)his attendants, proclaimed for Horus' sake when Horus was in his childhood (and his) sacrifices consisted of his beef cattle, his small cattle, and his pigs. As for (32)Imset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf, Horus is their Father, and Isis is their Mother. (35)Then Horus said to Re: ''Mayest thou give me my Brother in Pe and in Hieraconpolis of my company (to be) with me, (37)he being with (me by) perpetual assignment, that the earth may grow green and turmoil cease.'' (So) originated (39)his name of Horus on His Papyrus. I know the Souls of Pe. They are Horus, (41)Imset, and Hapi. Lift (42)your face(s), (O) gods who are in the nether world, to Osiris N. Behold, he (45)is become a great god. (lxxxiv) (BD 113)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hieraconpolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I know the secrets of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus and this (5)which his mother did concerning him. Said she: ''Pray let there be brought to us Sobk, lord of the farthest waters, that (7)he may fish (them) out.'' When he (had) found (them), his mother restored (them) to their proper place. Then said Sobk, lord of (9)the farthest waters: ''I sought and found (them, but) they kept slipping out from under my fingers (11)at the water's edge. (So) I netted them (12)with a net by main strength.'' That is how the net originated. Re said: ''Well, (14)why (does) Sobk (have) fish and find Horus' {my} hands for him in Fish Land? Say to Sobk: 'Keep secret (17)the secret about this net which brought Horus' (hands) to him. May it be exposed to view (only) on new-crescent day (19)and midmonth day in Fish Land.' '' Then said Re: ''I have given Hieraconpolis to Horus to (be) (21)the seat of his hands. May his (hands) be exposed to view in Hieraconpolis after they have been brought to him, and confine (23)the (genii) that are in them on new-crescent day and midmonth day.'' (24)Horus said: ''Verily Duamutef and (Qebeh)sen(u)f have been given (to) me (to be) with me, (for) they are the ones of my company that I have kept under guard. As for (the time) while I am there, (27)lo, the god of ?the temple? shall be silent.'' Then said Re: ''Put (them) there, even what thou hast given (29)me. Let there be done for them what is done for those who are in Hieraconpolis. So (shall) their corpse(s be) (31)with thee.'' Then Horus said: ''They were with thee, (but) (32)they shall be with me to hear Seth (and) his complaints.'' (Ye) Souls of Hieraconpolis, (34)(blessedness has been) g(iven) to me. I know the Souls of Hieraconpolis. They are Horus, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuf. (lxxxv) (BD 114)Spell for knowing the Souls of Hermopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(There is) ?a thrust (wound)? in the shoulder. Neit shines in the stronghold, and the eye ?consumes? him who judges (6)it. I know and have access to it, I know who brought (8)it from Cusae; (but) I will not tell men nor repeat to gods. I have come (10)on Re's errand (to) confirm the truth of the shoulder, (while) Neit shines in the stronghold (12)to inspect it. (I have) come as a mighty one because of knowing the Souls (14)of Hermopolis. The desire for knowledge is your desire. I know the truth, counted, (16)complete, and enduring. Hail to you, (18)Souls of Hermopolis, in accordance with your knowledge. They are Thoth, Perception, (20)and Atum. (lxxxvi) (BD 115)Spell for ascending to the Sky and gaining access to the underworld. Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)I grew large yesterday among the great ones; I came into being among those who had come into being. Look upon the Eye of the One, (6)?open to (me)? the form of darkness, (for) I am one of you. I know the Souls (8)of Heliopolis (and) him to whom (even) he whose strength is greatest has no access when passing by (and about) the extending of a hand (10)to us. ''I give tongue(s) to the gods,'' says he who would destroy the heir of Heliopolis. (12)I know why a tress is made for a male. It is (because) Re spoke (to) the King of Upper Egypt in his time. Then (15)his mouth was mutilated. That is how the diminution on new-crescent day came about. Said Re (to) him who was in his time: ''Take the 'thirty'-spear, (O) heir (18)of (men).'' That is how the court of the thirty originated through him who was in his time. (So) originated the Brother-Sister Pair, (and) so originated the ?6th-day? feast, (and so) originated (21)?he who hears the (spells written on) bright red linen (bandages)? without staying of his hand. (22)Then he assumed his tressed-woman form. So originated the tressed one of Heliopolis. (25)The Mighty had been bared in this temple{s}. So originated the bared one in Heliopolis. When the heir of his heir comes into being, many are (28)the things he shall see; and he shall become the great of strength, the god, even the son who makes (offerings) to his Father. (30)His portion shall become (that of) the great of strength in Heliopolis. (31)I know the Souls of Heliopolis. They are Re and Shu and Tefnut. (lxxxvii) (BD 116)Spell for knowing the Souls of Heliopolis. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(Neit) shines in Mata(t), truth has been extracted from the shoulder, and (6)the eye has been eaten by Him Who Counted It. I have access to it by the setem-priest, (but I) will not tell men nor (9)repeat to gods, and vice versa. I intrude not into what I know not; I see not the mysteries. Hail to you, (12)ye gods of Hermopolis. He who is large on new-crescent day (and) (diminished) on midmonth day--that is Thoth (15)the mysterious. (The others) are Perception and Atum. (17)(BD 117)Spell for taking the road in Rosetau. (19)To be said by Osiris N.: The road of my face is (22)toward Rosetau. It is I who clothed the great one with Greatness. I have come, I have come; I have established offerings in Abydos. (25)Open for me the road in Rosetau, (for) I have healed things in Osiris. (27)I am one who created water and assigned (his) throne. Make {my} way for me in the valley (and) in the lake of the Great One. Make (30)way for me, ?(for) thine and his am I?. (lxxxviii) (BD 118)Spell for reaching Rosetau. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (5)I am one who was born in Rosetau. Magic power has been given me (b)y those who are with (8)the mummies (as) a priest of Osiris. (I) receive (10)old age in Rosetau; I lead (the gods) through ?the (temple) doors? of Osiris. I am (13)the way, leading to them through the twin abodes of Osiris. (15)(BD 119)Spell for going forth from Rosetau. To be said by (17)Osiris N.: I am (20)the Great One who created his light. I have come unto thee (that I may praise thee) while washing away (23)thy efflux far from thee. (24)I set up my name in Rosetau, my power in Abydos. Pray raise (27)thyself, Osiris, that thou mayest circle this sky with Re, that thou mayest see (29)the common folk.

He goes in as (30)a falcon, he goes out as a phoenix. (O) Morning Star, (make) way for him, that he may enter in (33)peace into the goodly west. (34)He belongs to the pool of Osiris. Make way for Osiris N., that (38)he may enter and praise Osiris the lord of life. (xc) (BD 121)Spell for going in after going out.

Dung (is) my abomination; I will not eat it. Ordure, (10)?no? harm (shall come) therefrom. I will not touch it with my hands, I will not step on it with (12)the soles of my feet, because my bread is of white wheat and my beer of red barley (14)of the Inundation. It is the Night Bark and the Day Bark that have brought them to me, (and) I eat (16)beneath the boughs of the tamarisks. I know ?the bearer of the good?, (18)so that (I) shall recite for myself the hymn to the white crown and I shall wear the uraeus. O doorkeeper of (20)the Gladdeners of the Two Lands, even these makers of offerings, mayest thou let me bring (as offering) the daughter of truth, and (22)let (the god) Akhem open to me his arm(s). (23)May the Ennead keep silence (while) the sun-folk speak with Osiris N. (O thou) who guidest (26)the heart(s) of the gods, (my) power protects (me) in the sky (among) the Divine Images, the Creators. As for (28)any god or any goddess who may interfere with me, he is assigned to the progenitor(s) of Re, he is assigned to the Progenitors of the light. (31)The sunshine is clothing the sky among the gods. My portion is there of the bread of their (mouth(s)), ?(the mouths of) the gods?. I have come unto the Disk, (34)I have ascended unto the Moon. He speaks to me, his Followers the gods speak to me, (36)his sun-folk speak to me. They who are in darkness feel terror before me within the Great Flood beside the dreadful one, (39)(for) lo, I am there with Osiris; his mat is my mat. I tell him the words of men; I (repeat) to him the words of the gods: ''Come to me, (42)(O) equipped blessed one, (for) thou hast caused truth to ascend to (him who loves her).'' (43)I am a blessed one (better) equipped than any (other) blessed one, (as) perfect as the mummies of Heliopolis, Mendes, Heracleopolis, Abydos, Akhmim, and ?the Sanctuary?.

Osiris (2)N. (saw) the splitting of the ashed-tree{s} beside him in Rosetau. He is the fodder of the gods, who knows what is in their bellie(s). (4)He has come hither to cause to ascend and to testify to the truth and (to) equilibrate the balance among (5)the Silent Ones. O (god) high on his standard, lord of the atef-crown, who has ?set up? his name as lord (6)of the winds, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from thy Messengers who are over evil and bring about punishment, (8)in whose faces is no pity, because Osiris (N.) has done the truth for the Lord of Truth. He is (9)pure, his heart is pure. His front is clean, his rear is undefiled, his middle is (10)the site of truth. Not one of his members is impure.

''Let him come,'' say they, the gods, (of) Osiris N. ''Who, pray, (art thou)?'' say they to him. ''What, pray, is thy Name?'' (16)say they. I am Osiris N., the (17)lower growth (of) the papyrus plant; He Who Is in His Moringa Tree is the name (of) Osiris N. ''What (didst) thou pass by?'' say they to him. (I) pass(ed) by ?shrines? (19)north of a moringa tree. ''What, pray, didst thou see (there)?'' A leg and ?a thigh?. ''What, pray, (20)didst thou say to them?'' (I) have seen rejoicing in the lands of the Phoenicians. (21)''And what, pray, did they give thee?'' A firebrand and a block of green fayence. ''What, pray, (22)didst thou do with them?'' I buried (them) on that shore of the (m)aa(t)-lake (23)by night. ''And what, pray, didst thou find on it--that shore of the maa(t)-lake?'' (24)A scepter of flint. ''(Didst) thou take it?'' is asked. ''(Did) Osiris N. take it?'' ''What, pray, is (26)this scepter of flint?'' Breath-Giver is its Name. ''What, pray, didst thou do with {it} the firebrand (27)and the block of green fayence after thou hadst buried (them)?'' Osiris N. (exulted) over them, and he took (them) out. (29)He quenched the fire and he smashed the green block by throwing (them) (into the lake). ''Come thou, enter (30)into the broad hall of the City of the Two Truths, (for) thou know(est us).'' ''I will not let thee enter past me,'' (31)says the jamb of this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Plumb Bob (of) the Place of Truth is thy name.

''I will not let (35)thee pass by me,'' says the floor (of) this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Pillar of Geb is thy name. (36)''I will not open for thee,'' says the bolt, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' He Whom His Mother ?Announced? is thy name. (37)''I will not open for thee,'' says the ?housing? of the bolt, ''I will not let it (the bolt) go forth,'' says the ?channel? of (38)this gate, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' Living Eye of Sobk the Lord of the Eastern Range is thy name. (39)''Thou shalt not open to me, thou shalt not pass me,'' say the double doors, ''unless thou tellest my name.'' (Breast) of Shu when He Presented (40)Himself as Protection of Osiris is thy name. ''We will not let thee pass by us,'' say the rails, ''unless thou tellest (41)our name.'' Brats of Renenutet is your name. ''Thou knowest us; pass on.'' ''Thou shalt not tread upon me,'' (42)says the floor of this broad hall. But why? I am pure. ''Because thou knowest not the name (of) thy feet (43)(with) which thou treadest upon (me).'' I know the name of the feet with which I tread upon thee. ''Then tell me.'' {The seb(44)seb is mine.} Sebseb of Ha is the name of (my) right foot; Wenpet of Nephthys is the name of my (45)left foot. ''Tread thou upon us, for thou knowest us.'' ''(I) will not announce thee,'' says the doorkeeper, ''(un)less thou tellest my name.'' Perceiver (46)of Hearts, Searcher of Bellie(s), is thy name. ''(To) which god on duty shall I announce thee?'' And who, (47)pray, is the god on duty? ''The reckoner of the Two Lands will tell thee.'' And who, pray, is that--the reckoner of the Two Lands? (48)''It is Thoth.'' ''Here I am,'' says Thoth. ''For what purpose hast thou come?'' Osiris N. comes (49)to report. ''What, pray?'' says he to thee. I am pure from (50)all evil deeds. I am aloof from the quarrels of those who are (on duty) in their day; I am not in on them. (51)''(To) whom shall (I) announce thee?'' Announce (me) to (him) whose roof is of fire {of fire}, (52)whose wall is of living cobras, and whose floor is (of) water. ''(Who) is he?'' He is Osiris. ''Proceed, (53)then. Behold, thou art announced. Thy bread is the Sound Eye, thy beer is the Sound Eye; thy mortuary offering is the Sound Eye.'' Triumphant is (54)Osiris N. forever. To be said by (55)a man who is pure, when he has clothed himself in new raiment, is shod with white sandals, is anointed with the finest oil of myrrh, and has presented bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (kinds of) vegetables. Lo, copy for thyself this (text) in writing on a (56)clean ground with Nubian pigment overlaid with soil on which no small cattle have trodden. If this roll is used in his behalf, he shall continue to thrive as (shall) his children's children, (for) he is guiltless. He shall be an intimate of the King (and) his courtiers. There shall be given (57)him a cake, a loaf, milk, and a chunk of meat from the altar of the great god. He shall not be kept away from any gate of the west{erners}.

(has) followed and praises the Disk. He has joined the (sun-)praising (baboons); (11)he is one of them. He has been the companion of Isis and the associate of Nephthys; he has made powerful their magic spell(s). He has attached the towrope. (14)He has repulsed his enemy, he has restrained his steps. Re extends his hands to him; his Crew shall not repulse him. (16)If Osiris N. is powerful, the Sound Eye is powerful, and vice versa. To be said over (19)this Image that is sketched, sketched on a new, clean, unused sheet of papyrus with powder of glaze and (21)myrrh-water, placed at a man's breast without its coming (too) close. He embarks in the bark of Re (23)daily, and Thoth looks after him at disembarking and embarking. A truly excellent spell. Thou shalt sketch it in (25)careful outline, likewise the bark of Re. As for the powder of glaze, it is mentioned in order to emphasize the green, (27)this with which the document is to be written. Osiris N. erects the Pillar and sets up (30)the tie-amulet. He sails wherever he will. (31)Gracious is the remark that Thoth made to Re, the sanctuary being content with its Lord Re. Said Thoth: (33)''Look after his Soul at disembarking and embarking in the bark of Re, while the corpse is to remain in its place.'' (c) (BD 130)Roll for initiating the Soul forever and letting it board the bark of Re to pass by the courtiers of the nether world. (1)To be recited on Osiris' birthday. To be said by Osiris N.: Open, Sky; open (2)earth. Open to me, southerners; open, northerners; open, westerners; open, easterners. Open, double shrine (3)of Upper Egypt; open, double shrine of Lower Egypt. Open, double doors, open, gate(s), to Re, that he may ascend from the Horizon. (4)Open to him, double doors of the Night Bark; open to him, gate(s) of the Day Bark. He inhales Shu; he has created Tefnut. (5)They who are in his train follow him. Osiris N. is (6)Re's follower, one who takes on his character, who provides for his sanctuary like Horus when his fate overtakes him, (7)whose seat is hidden in the ?purity? of his shrine, an envoy of the god to her whom he has loved. Osiris N. has taken (8)(truth); he has offered up her image. He has taken and bound (9)the shrine. He abominates storms; there is no Starry Ho(st) beside him. He has not (been kept away) from Re or Osiris; (10)he has not been warded off by him who accomplishes with his hands. He has not walked in the valley of darkness; he has not entered the lake of the guilty. (11)He is not of those that pour out time; he has not fallen as prey in the place among (those) taken before him (12)around Sopd's slaughtering-place. ?Praise to? you, ?Kneelers?. The God's knife is in concealment; (13)Geb's arms ?become active at? dawn. As for him who is indeed refreshed, he shall lead Older than he and younger in his ((good) time). (14)Now while Thoth is in concealment he (Thoth) has purified (him who takes account of) millions, who opens the sky and dispels cloudiness (15)from about him. (When Osiris N. has reached him) in his seat, he (N.) grasps his staff, he (takes) his scepter, beside Re, (great) (16)(of beautiful goings). The Great One (Re) rises after his eye, (his) Ennead (being around) his seat. They do away with (17)his suffering and his illness when he is sick. Osiris (N.) has done away with his suffering, he refreshes him (N.); illumined for him is the face of Thoth. He praises Re, (and) (19)he (Re) hearkens (to him) and has set up obstacles against his enemies. Osiris N. has not been left boatless, (20)he has not been kept from the Horizon, (for) he is in his knees, for his Name, even Re's name, is in the belly of Osiris (N.) and (22)his dignity is in his mouth. He tells (it) to him, and he hears his words. Praise (be) to thee, Re, lord of the Horizon, Osiris, presider over the westerners. (23)Hail to thee, for whom the sun-folk purify themselves and the Sky brings (offerings) to that great abode past which lead the courses (24)of the rebellious. Behold, Osiris N. is come; he has proclaimed the truth, since {his} marvels are in the west. (25)He has broken the fury of Apophis; he is Ruty. Osiris (N.), he has proclaimed the protection of those who are with him before (26)the great seat. Mayest thou hearken to (him) when Osiris N. enters (27)into the Council. He (drives off) Apophis from Re every day, so that he does not attack him when he wakes. (28)He seizes (the writings); he has received the offerings. He has equipped Thoth with his Eye. He has caused that truth circle about (29)at the prow of the great bark that bears him who is true of speech in the Council. He has established Millions; he has led the courtiers. (30)Osiris N. gives to them a voyage in joy of face. Re's Crew circles about, following (31)his beauty; truth rises high, she circles about her Lord. He (N.) gives praise to the Lord of the Universe. He has taken the staff; (32)he has ?swept? the Sky therewith. The sun-folk give him praise as when rises Horus the unwearying. (33)He exalts Re (by) that which he has done. He has dispelled cloudiness, he has seen his beauty, he has established (34)his course. He circles about, he proceeds to the Bark in the Sky; he shows himself as the sunshine. Osiris N. is the great one in the midst (35)of his eye, sitting (or) kneeling in the great bark of Khepri. He comes into being, and what he says comes into being; he is this (36)which circles the sky toward the west. Verily the Starry Ho(st) rise, while Shu is in rejoicing; they take (37)Re's bow rope from his (crew). As Re circles about, he sees Osiris; entrusted to him is Osiris N. (38)in peace, in peace. He (N.) has not been kept away, he has not been seized, by the scorching breath that is in thy instant. No hindrance has gone forth from thy mouth against him; he has not gone ?with? the crocodile. (39)His abomination is crocodiles; they have not attacked him. He embarks in thy bark; he takes over thy throne. He assumes thy dignity; he follows the paths of Re. (40)His praises shall drive away that noxious one who comes aflame against (thy) Bark (in) this great district. Osiris N., he knows him; (41)he cannot reach thy bark (while) Osiris N. is (therein). It is he who makes offerings to the Gods and mortuary offerings (42)to the blessed. To be said over an image of this initiate put into this bark, after thou hast made the Night Bark at its right side and the Day Bark (43)at its left side. Offer to them bread and beer, oxen and fowl, burnt incense, and all (other) good things on Osiris' birthday. If this is done for him, (44)his Soul shall stay alive forever. It shall not die again. (This is) a secret of the nether world, a mystery in the god's domain. Found in the Palace of the Great House (45)under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, ?Khasety? justified, (as though) found in a mountain cave. (This) is what Horus used (for) his Father Osiris Unnofer justified. Since Re looks upon (46)this blessed one as himself, looks upon him as upon his Ennead, great is the fear of him, great is the esteem of him in the heart(s) of men and Gods and the blessed and the dead. His corpse and (47)his Soul shall live forever; he shall not die again in the god's domain. He shall not be left over on the judgment day; he shall be justified against his enemies. His offerings shall be on (48)the altar of Re daily. (ci) (BD 131)Spell for proceeding to the Sky beside Re. (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Re it is who shines this night. As for every man who is in his train, he shall stay alive as a follower (6)of Thoth. He shall give ?the crown? to Horus this night and joy to Osiris, be(8)cause he is one among these while his enemies are well disposed of.","part","N"

"ab","text","(Column I) Copy of a record of legal proceeding. From the minutes of ..., defensor of the Arsinoite. In the consulate of our lord Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 22. In the presence of NN son of NN, Chairemon son of Gerontios, Gerontios son of Ammonios, and Hierakapollon, councillors, and NN (office), Neilos the Nilometres, Anoubion chief assistant and Elias and Sambas public servants of the defensor, Taesis and Herais, daughters of NN, from the village of Karanis, acting through their mandatary Nilos, who is present, petition against the heirs of Atisios. Theodoros, advocate, read: "In the consulate of our lords Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 15. Aurelia Taesis daughter of NN from the village of Karanis of the Arsinoite nome to the husband of her other sister Herais, Aurelius Nilos son of NN, from the metropolis, greetings. Since a lawsuit has arisen between us and the heirs of Atisis concerning [property, of which they allege that they] belonged [to our father] Atisis, even though they have absolutely nothing to do with hm, and since I myself am not able [because I am a weak woman, to represent myself] before the defensor, who at the instructions of his Highness the Prefect of Egypt [to whom we submitted a petition?] has been given us as judge, therefore I appoint and authorize you and give you full power to conduct the proceedings against them . . . in accordance with the rights which belong to us, as if I were present. This mandate is authoritative and secure with respect to everything which will be transacted there. I have drwn up this mandate, which is authoritative wherever it is produced, in a single copy for you. I, Aurelius Morion, wrote for her because she is illiterate." After the reading, Theodoros, advocate, said, "My clients, being burdened improperly and contrary to the laws concerning plots of land which do not belong to them, have fled through petitions before his lordship the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, and permit me to enter into the record what his highness ordered." The defensor said to Theodoros, "Read the orders of my lord the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius." And he said, "I will read it." And he read, "Flavius Philagrius to the defensor of the Arsinoite, greetings. What Herais and Taesis have requested, you will be able to learn from the copy (Column II) of the attached petition. Take pains to give the necessary consideration to their request in accordance with the laws, but with no impediment to the collection of public dues in any way. Farewell." After the reading he added, "I shall now read the petition as well." After reading this, he added, "Neither thoughtlessly nor at random did my clients submit a petition to the Prefect." As he was continuing, Alexandros, advocate, said "Objection!" The defensor civitatis said to him, "State your objection." Alexandros said, "It would have suited my clients to plead the case before the higher court in order to have our opponents undergo punishment when their malice became evident. For there is nothing but malice in the petition which they submitted to the Prefect. And now I shall formally depose before this august court the objection which I just now proffered in order to prove to Your Excellency that our opponents have set the court in motion against us totally without reason. I have come before the court, relying on a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF ANYONE IS IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS, HIS POSSESSION IS IN NO WAY TO BE REMOVED FROM HIM NOR IS THE DATE OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION TO BE INVESTIGATED. "Now the father of our opponents owned in the vicinity of the village of Karanis fields which had been made over or ceded to him, we do not know which. He performed the cultivation of these fields, appropriated their produce to his private purse and likewise paid to the imperial treasury the public taxes levied upon them, with no dispute arising during the entire forty-five years in which he, I mean the father of our opponents, who incurred no reproach, was in possession. Now it seems, to be brief, that the father of our opponents died leaving as heirs his daughters, I mean our opponents, who, unable to meet the taxes demanded on the said fields, took to flight. What could the praepositus pagi do? Having an eye at once to his own safety and to the public revenues, he came to the village and assigned these fields to the peasants for cultivation. But one of our opponents married Nilos, the man here present in court, and made a claim against the villagers to collect rent because they had cultivated the plots during the previous year. She demanded rent and appropriated it to her private purse on the ground that she was still the owner of the land. "Therefore, since they deceived the higher authority, (Column III) I beg leave to read the divine an venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESION OF PROPERTY, NO ONE IS IN ANY WISE TO PROCED AGAINST HIS PROPERTY OR DISSOLVE HIS LONGSTANDING POSSESSION." The defensor said to him, "Read the divine and venerated law which you say you have at hand." "OUR MASTERS CONSTANTINE AUGUSTUS AND CONSTANTINE AND CONSTANTIUS MOST NOBLE CAESARS TO THE SENATOR AGRIPPINUS: IT IS OUR PLEASURE THAT CONSIDERATION BE TAKEN ALSO OF THE LENGTH OF THE POSSESSION TO THE EXTENT THAT, IF IT IS ESTABLISHED BY INQUIRIY FROM THEM THAT THE PROPERTY (?) WITH WHICH THE INVESTIGATION IS CONCERNED HAS BEEN HELD FOR FORTY YEARS, NOT EVEN THE GROUNDS OF THE POSSESSION BE INVESTIGATED. IT IS OUR PLEASURE MOREOVER THAT, SINCE LEGAL GROUNDS OF POSSESSION ARE NECESSARY (?) ONLY FOR PRESCRIPTION AFTER TEN OR TWENTY YEARS, THE PRESENT HOLDER BE AWARDED THE PROTECTION OF THE COURT, (etc.)." After the reading, the defensor said to Alexandros, "You should read also the deed of cession issued to them, in order that we may know the interval of time and that action may be taken in accordance with the divine law." Alexandros said, "Whether the fields were made over or were ceded, we do not know, for it was a long time ago." The defensor said to the advocate Theodoros, "How long is it since your (clients') father died?" Theodoros said, "Not long." Alexandros said, "The space of forty years and more has elapsed with them in possession of the fields." The defensor said to him, "How many years is it since the official survey by Sabinus the then censitor?" Theodoros said, "Barely thirty-three." The defensor said to him, "Who gathered in the harvest last year?" Theodoros said, "The villagers." Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, said, "The villagers." Theodoros said, "Since my clients had been in flight for five years and more and were living away from the village, and since the taxes on the land devolved upon the villagers, the latter cultivated the land. Then, when my clients returned to their native village, the villagers handed over to them the fields. But they handed over also the property from the estate of Atisios, because the actual owners of that property were firmly maintaining their claim that the land was absolutely not their own. For this reason, my clients fled for refuge to my lord, the most illustrious prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, to ask that they should not be troubled in any way on account of the said fields, but that each one should keep his own plots and not be held responsible for others' plots. Therefore, since the villagers, who can attest whose the fields are and who did the sowing of them, are also present, I respectfully request permission to bring them forward for questioning." The defensor said to Germanos, "What does Germanos, here present, say? For what reason did you villagers sow this land?" Through Anoubion, interpreting for him, he said, "We sowed these fields as a precaution lest the taxes devolve upon us." The defensor said, "And how long is it since you began sowing them?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "We sowed them for one indiction only." The defensor said to him, "And how is it that you have now handed them over to Nilos and the women?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "Because we agree that the fields are their property." The defensor said to him, "Did you give them back the land under seed?" Through the same interpreter (Column IV) he answered, "No, but we gave them three artabas of wheat for each aroura." Theodoros, advocate, said, "He lies. My clients received nothing, but were compelled . . . to accept (?) . . . the said plots." The defensor said, "Then, if you were being compelled, you ought immediately to have complained through petitions and above all not have accepted rent." Nilos said through the interpreter, "I did go immediately to the praepositus, and he said to me, `Bring a petition before the Prefect.'" Alexandros said, "Well, then, in order the more completely to convince your Grace, there is also a house in this city registered in the same name (i.e., Atisios) and held by our opponents from their father's succession." The defensor said to Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, "You have heard him, your opponent, say that you possess also a house registered in the same name as the plots, and you must depose whether or not you are in possession of a house or part thereof." Nilos said through Anoubion, the Chief Assistant acting as interpreter, I do not know if there is a house." The defensor said to him, "Well, then, who pockets the rent?" Through the same interpreter, he answered, "Nobody. It has burned down." The defensor said to him, "How is it, then, that at first you denied there was a house in this name, and now you admit that there was but that it has burned down?" Nilos replied through the same interpreter, "Because-I don't know anything. And they haven't received any rent." The defensor said, "Whereas a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal rulers, set down in the records of My Mediocrity, expressly orders that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY, THE LEGALITY OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION IS NOT TO BE INVESTIGATED; since in addition Germanos from the village of Karanis has deposed that Herois and Taesis and their families are in possession of property from the estate of Atisios and that because they were formerly in flight the fields were sown by the villagers; and since even the husband of Herois, appointed by the women to appear in court on their behalf, has deposed that he recognizes also the house registered in the same name as the fields: "Therefore, it follows from the divine and venerated law itself, and from the longstanding possession, and is in accordance also with the testimony of Germanos the headman of the village of Karanis, that Herois and Taesis are to retain ownership of the said plots, and are to pay the imperial taxes on them as in the past, since they possess also the house and the entire estate registered in the same name. For it is not the place of My Mediocrity, since a divine law is applicable, to disturb a longstanding possession." Nilos said, "I appeal." The defensor said to him, "..."","part","N"

"ab","text","(Column I) Copy of a record of legal proceeding. From the minutes of ..., defensor of the Arsinoite. In the consulate of our lord Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 22. In the presence of NN son of NN, Chairemon son of Gerontios, Gerontios son of Ammonios, and Hierakapollon, councillors, and NN (office), Neilos the Nilometres, Anoubion chief assistant and Elias and Sambas public servants of the defensor, Taesis and Herais, daughters of NN, from the village of Karanis, acting through their mandatary Nilos, who is present, petition against the heirs of Atisios. Theodoros, advocate, read: "In the consulate of our lords Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 15. Aurelia Taesis daughter of NN from the village of Karanis of the Arsinoite nome to the husband of her other sister Herais, Aurelius Nilos son of NN, from the metropolis, greetings. Since a lawsuit has arisen between us and the heirs of Atisis concerning [property, of which they allege that they] belonged [to our father] Atisis, even though they have absolutely nothing to do with hm, and since I myself am not able [because I am a weak woman, to represent myself] before the defensor, who at the instructions of his Highness the Prefect of Egypt [to whom we submitted a petition?] has been given us as judge, therefore I appoint and authorize you and give you full power to conduct the proceedings against them . . . in accordance with the rights which belong to us, as if I were present. This mandate is authoritative and secure with respect to everything which will be transacted there. I have drwn up this mandate, which is authoritative wherever it is produced, in a single copy for you. I, Aurelius Morion, wrote for her because she is illiterate." After the reading, Theodoros, advocate, said, "My clients, being burdened improperly and contrary to the laws concerning plots of land which do not belong to them, have fled through petitions before his lordship the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, and permit me to enter into the record what his highness ordered." The defensor said to Theodoros, "Read the orders of my lord the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius." And he said, "I will read it." And he read, "Flavius Philagrius to the defensor of the Arsinoite, greetings. What Herais and Taesis have requested, you will be able to learn from the copy (Column II) of the attached petition. Take pains to give the necessary consideration to their request in accordance with the laws, but with no impediment to the collection of public dues in any way. Farewell." After the reading he added, "I shall now read the petition as well." After reading this, he added, "Neither thoughtlessly nor at random did my clients submit a petition to the Prefect." As he was continuing, Alexandros, advocate, said "Objection!" The defensor civitatis said to him, "State your objection." Alexandros said, "It would have suited my clients to plead the case before the higher court in order to have our opponents undergo punishment when their malice became evident. For there is nothing but malice in the petition which they submitted to the Prefect. And now I shall formally depose before this august court the objection which I just now proffered in order to prove to Your Excellency that our opponents have set the court in motion against us totally without reason. I have come before the court, relying on a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF ANYONE IS IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS, HIS POSSESSION IS IN NO WAY TO BE REMOVED FROM HIM NOR IS THE DATE OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION TO BE INVESTIGATED. "Now the father of our opponents owned in the vicinity of the village of Karanis fields which had been made over or ceded to him, we do not know which. He performed the cultivation of these fields, appropriated their produce to his private purse and likewise paid to the imperial treasury the public taxes levied upon them, with no dispute arising during the entire forty-five years in which he, I mean the father of our opponents, who incurred no reproach, was in possession. Now it seems, to be brief, that the father of our opponents died leaving as heirs his daughters, I mean our opponents, who, unable to meet the taxes demanded on the said fields, took to flight. What could the praepositus pagi do? Having an eye at once to his own safety and to the public revenues, he came to the village and assigned these fields to the peasants for cultivation. But one of our opponents married Nilos, the man here present in court, and made a claim against the villagers to collect rent because they had cultivated the plots during the previous year. She demanded rent and appropriated it to her private purse on the ground that she was still the owner of the land. "Therefore, since they deceived the higher authority, (Column III) I beg leave to read the divine an venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESION OF PROPERTY, NO ONE IS IN ANY WISE TO PROCED AGAINST HIS PROPERTY OR DISSOLVE HIS LONGSTANDING POSSESSION." The defensor said to him, "Read the divine and venerated law which you say you have at hand." "OUR MASTERS CONSTANTINE AUGUSTUS AND CONSTANTINE AND CONSTANTIUS MOST NOBLE CAESARS TO THE SENATOR AGRIPPINUS: IT IS OUR PLEASURE THAT CONSIDERATION BE TAKEN ALSO OF THE LENGTH OF THE POSSESSION TO THE EXTENT THAT, IF IT IS ESTABLISHED BY INQUIRIY FROM THEM THAT THE PROPERTY (?) WITH WHICH THE INVESTIGATION IS CONCERNED HAS BEEN HELD FOR FORTY YEARS, NOT EVEN THE GROUNDS OF THE POSSESSION BE INVESTIGATED. IT IS OUR PLEASURE MOREOVER THAT, SINCE LEGAL GROUNDS OF POSSESSION ARE NECESSARY (?) ONLY FOR PRESCRIPTION AFTER TEN OR TWENTY YEARS, THE PRESENT HOLDER BE AWARDED THE PROTECTION OF THE COURT, (etc.)." After the reading, the defensor said to Alexandros, "You should read also the deed of cession issued to them, in order that we may know the interval of time and that action may be taken in accordance with the divine law." Alexandros said, "Whether the fields were made over or were ceded, we do not know, for it was a long time ago." The defensor said to the advocate Theodoros, "How long is it since your (clients') father died?" Theodoros said, "Not long." Alexandros said, "The space of forty years and more has elapsed with them in possession of the fields." The defensor said to him, "How many years is it since the official survey by Sabinus the then censitor?" Theodoros said, "Barely thirty-three." The defensor said to him, "Who gathered in the harvest last year?" Theodoros said, "The villagers." Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, said, "The villagers." Theodoros said, "Since my clients had been in flight for five years and more and were living away from the village, and since the taxes on the land devolved upon the villagers, the latter cultivated the land. Then, when my clients returned to their native village, the villagers handed over to them the fields. But they handed over also the property from the estate of Atisios, because the actual owners of that property were firmly maintaining their claim that the land was absolutely not their own. For this reason, my clients fled for refuge to my lord, the most illustrious prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, to ask that they should not be troubled in any way on account of the said fields, but that each one should keep his own plots and not be held responsible for others' plots. Therefore, since the villagers, who can attest whose the fields are and who did the sowing of them, are also present, I respectfully request permission to bring them forward for questioning." The defensor said to Germanos, "What does Germanos, here present, say? For what reason did you villagers sow this land?" Through Anoubion, interpreting for him, he said, "We sowed these fields as a precaution lest the taxes devolve upon us." The defensor said, "And how long is it since you began sowing them?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "We sowed them for one indiction only." The defensor said to him, "And how is it that you have now handed them over to Nilos and the women?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "Because we agree that the fields are their property." The defensor said to him, "Did you give them back the land under seed?" Through the same interpreter (Column IV) he answered, "No, but we gave them three artabas of wheat for each aroura." Theodoros, advocate, said, "He lies. My clients received nothing, but were compelled . . . to accept (?) . . . the said plots." The defensor said, "Then, if you were being compelled, you ought immediately to have complained through petitions and above all not have accepted rent." Nilos said through the interpreter, "I did go immediately to the praepositus, and he said to me, `Bring a petition before the Prefect.'" Alexandros said, "Well, then, in order the more completely to convince your Grace, there is also a house in this city registered in the same name (i.e., Atisios) and held by our opponents from their father's succession." The defensor said to Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, "You have heard him, your opponent, say that you possess also a house registered in the same name as the plots, and you must depose whether or not you are in possession of a house or part thereof." Nilos said through Anoubion, the Chief Assistant acting as interpreter, I do not know if there is a house." The defensor said to him, "Well, then, who pockets the rent?" Through the same interpreter, he answered, "Nobody. It has burned down." The defensor said to him, "How is it, then, that at first you denied there was a house in this name, and now you admit that there was but that it has burned down?" Nilos replied through the same interpreter, "Because-I don't know anything. And they haven't received any rent." The defensor said, "Whereas a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal rulers, set down in the records of My Mediocrity, expressly orders that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY, THE LEGALITY OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION IS NOT TO BE INVESTIGATED; since in addition Germanos from the village of Karanis has deposed that Herois and Taesis and their families are in possession of property from the estate of Atisios and that because they were formerly in flight the fields were sown by the villagers; and since even the husband of Herois, appointed by the women to appear in court on their behalf, has deposed that he recognizes also the house registered in the same name as the fields: "Therefore, it follows from the divine and venerated law itself, and from the longstanding possession, and is in accordance also with the testimony of Germanos the headman of the village of Karanis, that Herois and Taesis are to retain ownership of the said plots, and are to pay the imperial taxes on them as in the past, since they possess also the house and the entire estate registered in the same name. For it is not the place of My Mediocrity, since a divine law is applicable, to disturb a longstanding possession." Nilos said, "I appeal." The defensor said to him, "..."","part","N"

In the consulate of our lord Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 22. In the presence of NN son of NN, Chairemon son of Gerontios, Gerontios son of Ammonios, and Hierakapollon, councillors, and NN (office), Neilos the Nilometres, Anoubion chief assistant and Elias and Sambas public servants of the defensor, Taesis and Herais, daughters of NN, from the village of Karanis, acting through their mandatary Nilos, who is present, petition against the heirs of Atisios. Theodoros, advocate, read: "In the consulate of our lords Constantius for the 2nd time and Constans for the 1st time, Augusti, Pachon 15. Aurelia Taesis daughter of NN from the village of Karanis of the Arsinoite nome to the husband of her other sister Herais, Aurelius Nilos son of NN, from the metropolis, greetings. Since a lawsuit has arisen between us and the heirs of Atisis concerning [property, of which they allege that they] belonged [to our father] Atisis, even though they have absolutely nothing to do with hm, and since I myself am not able [because I am a weak woman, to represent myself] before the defensor, who at the instructions of his Highness the Prefect of Egypt [to whom we submitted a petition?] has been given us as judge, therefore I appoint and authorize you and give you full power to conduct the proceedings against them . . . in accordance with the rights which belong to us, as if I were present. This mandate is authoritative and secure with respect to everything which will be transacted there. I have drwn up this mandate, which is authoritative wherever it is produced, in a single copy for you. I, Aurelius Morion, wrote for her because she is illiterate." After the reading, Theodoros, advocate, said, "My clients, being burdened improperly and contrary to the laws concerning plots of land which do not belong to them, have fled through petitions before his lordship the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, and permit me to enter into the record what his highness ordered." The defensor said to Theodoros, "Read the orders of my lord the most brilliant prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius." And he said, "I will read it." And he read, "Flavius Philagrius to the defensor of the Arsinoite, greetings. What Herais and Taesis have requested, you will be able to learn from the copy (Column II) of the attached petition. Take pains to give the necessary consideration to their request in accordance with the laws, but with no impediment to the collection of public dues in any way. Farewell." After the reading he added, "I shall now read the petition as well." After reading this, he added, "Neither thoughtlessly nor at random did my clients submit a petition to the Prefect." As he was continuing, Alexandros, advocate, said "Objection!" The defensor civitatis said to him, "State your objection." Alexandros said, "It would have suited my clients to plead the case before the higher court in order to have our opponents undergo punishment when their malice became evident. For there is nothing but malice in the petition which they submitted to the Prefect. And now I shall formally depose before this august court the objection which I just now proffered in order to prove to Your Excellency that our opponents have set the court in motion against us totally without reason. I have come before the court, relying on a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF ANYONE IS IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS, HIS POSSESSION IS IN NO WAY TO BE REMOVED FROM HIM NOR IS THE DATE OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION TO BE INVESTIGATED. "Now the father of our opponents owned in the vicinity of the village of Karanis fields which had been made over or ceded to him, we do not know which. He performed the cultivation of these fields, appropriated their produce to his private purse and likewise paid to the imperial treasury the public taxes levied upon them, with no dispute arising during the entire forty-five years in which he, I mean the father of our opponents, who incurred no reproach, was in possession. Now it seems, to be brief, that the father of our opponents died leaving as heirs his daughters, I mean our opponents, who, unable to meet the taxes demanded on the said fields, took to flight. What could the praepositus pagi do? Having an eye at once to his own safety and to the public revenues, he came to the village and assigned these fields to the peasants for cultivation. But one of our opponents married Nilos, the man here present in court, and made a claim against the villagers to collect rent because they had cultivated the plots during the previous year. She demanded rent and appropriated it to her private purse on the ground that she was still the owner of the land. "Therefore, since they deceived the higher authority, (Column III) I beg leave to read the divine an venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESION OF PROPERTY, NO ONE IS IN ANY WISE TO PROCED AGAINST HIS PROPERTY OR DISSOLVE HIS LONGSTANDING POSSESSION."

"OUR MASTERS CONSTANTINE AUGUSTUS AND CONSTANTINE AND CONSTANTIUS MOST NOBLE CAESARS TO THE SENATOR AGRIPPINUS: IT IS OUR PLEASURE THAT CONSIDERATION BE TAKEN ALSO OF THE LENGTH OF THE POSSESSION TO THE EXTENT THAT, IF IT IS ESTABLISHED BY INQUIRIY FROM THEM THAT THE PROPERTY (?)

I have come before the court, relying on a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF ANYONE IS IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS, HIS POSSESSION IS IN NO WAY TO BE REMOVED FROM HIM NOR IS THE DATE OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION TO BE INVESTIGATED. "Now the father of our opponents owned in the vicinity of the village of Karanis fields which had been made over or ceded to him, we do not know which. He performed the cultivation of these fields, appropriated their produce to his private purse and likewise paid to the imperial treasury the public taxes levied upon them, with no dispute arising during the entire forty-five years in which he, I mean the father of our opponents, who incurred no reproach, was in possession. Now it seems, to be brief, that the father of our opponents died leaving as heirs his daughters, I mean our opponents, who, unable to meet the taxes demanded on the said fields, took to flight. What could the praepositus pagi do? Having an eye at once to his own safety and to the public revenues, he came to the village and assigned these fields to the peasants for cultivation. But one of our opponents married Nilos, the man here present in court, and made a claim against the villagers to collect rent because they had cultivated the plots during the previous year. She demanded rent and appropriated it to her private purse on the ground that she was still the owner of the land. "Therefore, since they deceived the higher authority, (Column III) I beg leave to read the divine an venerated law of our masters, the eternal Augusti, which provides that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESION OF PROPERTY, NO ONE IS IN ANY WISE TO PROCED AGAINST HIS PROPERTY OR DISSOLVE HIS LONGSTANDING POSSESSION." The defensor said to him, "Read the divine and venerated law which you say you have at hand." "OUR MASTERS CONSTANTINE AUGUSTUS AND CONSTANTINE AND CONSTANTIUS MOST NOBLE CAESARS TO THE SENATOR AGRIPPINUS: IT IS OUR PLEASURE THAT CONSIDERATION BE TAKEN ALSO OF THE LENGTH OF THE POSSESSION TO THE EXTENT THAT, IF IT IS ESTABLISHED BY INQUIRIY FROM THEM THAT THE PROPERTY (?) WITH WHICH THE INVESTIGATION IS CONCERNED HAS BEEN HELD FOR FORTY YEARS, NOT EVEN THE GROUNDS OF THE POSSESSION BE INVESTIGATED. IT IS OUR PLEASURE MOREOVER THAT, SINCE LEGAL GROUNDS OF POSSESSION ARE NECESSARY (?) ONLY FOR PRESCRIPTION AFTER TEN OR TWENTY YEARS, THE PRESENT HOLDER BE AWARDED THE PROTECTION OF THE COURT, (etc.)." After the reading, the defensor said to Alexandros, "You should read also the deed of cession issued to them, in order that we may know the interval of time and that action may be taken in accordance with the divine law." Alexandros said, "Whether the fields were made over or were ceded, we do not know, for it was a long time ago." The defensor said to the advocate Theodoros, "How long is it since your (clients') father died?" Theodoros said, "Not long." Alexandros said, "The space of forty years and more has elapsed with them in possession of the fields." The defensor said to him, "How many years is it since the official survey by Sabinus the then censitor?" Theodoros said, "Barely thirty-three." The defensor said to him, "Who gathered in the harvest last year?" Theodoros said, "The villagers." Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, said, "The villagers." Theodoros said, "Since my clients had been in flight for five years and more and were living away from the village, and since the taxes on the land devolved upon the villagers, the latter cultivated the land. Then, when my clients returned to their native village, the villagers handed over to them the fields. But they handed over also the property from the estate of Atisios, because the actual owners of that property were firmly maintaining their claim that the land was absolutely not their own. For this reason, my clients fled for refuge to my lord, the most illustrious prefect of Egypt, Flavius Philagrius, to ask that they should not be troubled in any way on account of the said fields, but that each one should keep his own plots and not be held responsible for others' plots. Therefore, since the villagers, who can attest whose the fields are and who did the sowing of them, are also present, I respectfully request permission to bring them forward for questioning." The defensor said to Germanos, "What does Germanos, here present, say? For what reason did you villagers sow this land?" Through Anoubion, interpreting for him, he said, "We sowed these fields as a precaution lest the taxes devolve upon us." The defensor said, "And how long is it since you began sowing them?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "We sowed them for one indiction only." The defensor said to him, "And how is it that you have now handed them over to Nilos and the women?" Through the same interpreter he answered, "Because we agree that the fields are their property." The defensor said to him, "Did you give them back the land under seed?" Through the same interpreter (Column IV) he answered, "No, but we gave them three artabas of wheat for each aroura." Theodoros, advocate, said, "He lies. My clients received nothing, but were compelled . . . to accept (?) . . . the said plots." The defensor said, "Then, if you were being compelled, you ought immediately to have complained through petitions and above all not have accepted rent." Nilos said through the interpreter, "I did go immediately to the praepositus, and he said to me, `Bring a petition before the Prefect.'" Alexandros said, "Well, then, in order the more completely to convince your Grace, there is also a house in this city registered in the same name (i.e., Atisios) and held by our opponents from their father's succession." The defensor said to Nilos, appearing on behalf of Herois and Taesis, "You have heard him, your opponent, say that you possess also a house registered in the same name as the plots, and you must depose whether or not you are in possession of a house or part thereof." Nilos said through Anoubion, the Chief Assistant acting as interpreter, I do not know if there is a house." The defensor said to him, "Well, then, who pockets the rent?" Through the same interpreter, he answered, "Nobody. It has burned down." The defensor said to him, "How is it, then, that at first you denied there was a house in this name, and now you admit that there was but that it has burned down?" Nilos replied through the same interpreter, "Because-I don't know anything. And they haven't received any rent." The defensor said, "Whereas a divine and venerated law of our masters, the eternal rulers, set down in the records of My Mediocrity, expressly orders that IF A PERIOD OF FORTY YEARS HAS ELAPSED WITH A PERSON IN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY, THE LEGALITY OF THE INCEPTION OF POSSESSION IS NOT TO BE INVESTIGATED; since in addition Germanos from the village of Karanis has deposed that Herois and Taesis and their families are in possession of property from the estate of Atisios and that because they were formerly in flight the fields were sown by the villagers; and since even the husband of Herois, appointed by the women to appear in court on their behalf, has deposed that he recognizes also the house registered in the same name as the fields: "Therefore, it follows from the divine and venerated law itself, and from the longstanding possession, and is in accordance also with the testimony of Germanos the headman of the village of Karanis, that Herois and Taesis are to retain ownership of the said plots, and are to pay the imperial taxes on them as in the past, since they possess also the house and the entire estate registered in the same name. For it is not the place of My Mediocrity, since a divine law is applicable, to disturb a longstanding possession." Nilos said, "I appeal." The defensor said to him, "..."","part","N"

"summary","text","The document contains eleven declarations of land for the census of the year 302 A.D. All are of the same day (Thoth 26), this being the date preserved in five of the eleven columns, with a portion of the date in other columns. The eleven declarations are from Karanis, Arsinoe and Ptolemais Nea, but the plots declared are without exception about the village of Ptolemais Nea. The head of the census is the same Septimius Sabinus who had charge of the work in that none five years earlier (see P.Corn. 19 = P.Corn. inv. no II 30).;The census was instituted in accordance with an imperial decree which was sent abroad over Egypt by order of the catholicos, at that time being Valerius Euethius. The first step was a declaration made by landowners and landholders to the censitor of all the taxable land held by them. In our document the primary declaration had been made a short time before, as appears from the phrase "apo tes apographeises up' emou proen epi Sabeino kensitori". The next move was taken by the goverment officials. The land reported as "chersos" or "adespotos" was checked over by the bureau of the landmeasurer ("anametretes"). In our document this occured in the month Thoth at the height of the flood season. The investigation was designed to determine what amount of the land reported by individuals as "dry" or "ownerless" should actually be classified as seed land ("en spora" or "sporime ge"). The peasant landowner or landlord was held responsible both for correct measurement and for declaration of the gain of the goverment resulting from the substitution of "seed land" for the "dry" and "tenantless" amounts primarily reported.;It is at this point that the action and report envisaged in the present Cornell papyrus. Accompanied by three recognised surveyros ("geometrai"), the peasant owner or tenant had measured the "chersos" and "adespotos" portions of his plots which the goverment had designated as probably transferable to the classification of "basilike ge sporime". Note that in all these cases the landmeasurer had meantime "found" that the land was seed land. Three village officials accompanied the peasant owner or tenant and the three surveyors. These were the boundary official ("oriodeiktes"), the village headman ("meizon tes komes") and the village chief ("komarches"). Upon agreement reached by them the tenant declared under imperial oath the amount of his land which was to be transferred from the classification of ownerless goverment land to the higher production category of "royal seedd land" (with higher rate of rent) or from the category of private dry land to that of private seed land (with corresponding increase in the land tax).;Egypt had been the scene of serious disturbance during the suppression of the revolt of L.Domitius Domitianus (Achilleus) in A.D. 295-296 A.D. In A.D. 302 the situation was so acute that Diocletian diverted a part of the grain which normally went to Rome for the relief of Alexandria. For the census of the year 302 special inducements must have been offred to the peasants to take abandoned goverment land. The nature of these inducements we cannot know. Their results, hoever, are apparent in this census roll.","",""

"summary","text","The document contains eleven declarations of land for the census of the year 302 A.D. All are of the same day (Thoth 26), this being the date preserved in five of the eleven columns, with a portion of the date in other columns. The eleven declarations are from Karanis, Arsinoe and Ptolemais Nea, but the plots declared are without exception about the village of Ptolemais Nea. The head of the census is the same Septimius Sabinus who had charge of the work in that none five years earlier (see P.Corn. 19 = P.Corn. inv. no II 30).;The census was instituted in accordance with an imperial decree which was sent abroad over Egypt by order of the catholicos, at that time being Valerius Euethius. The first step was a declaration made by landowners and landholders to the censitor of all the taxable land held by them. In our document the primary declaration had been made a short time before, as appears from the phrase "apo tes apographeises up' emou proen epi Sabeino kensitori". The next move was taken by the goverment officials. The land reported as "chersos" or "adespotos" was checked over by the bureau of the landmeasurer ("anametretes"). In our document this occured in the month Thoth at the height of the flood season. The investigation was designed to determine what amount of the land reported by individuals as "dry" or "ownerless" should actually be classified as seed land ("en spora" or "sporime ge"). The peasant landowner or landlord was held responsible both for correct measurement and for declaration of the gain of the goverment resulting from the substitution of "seed land" for the "dry" and "tenantless" amounts primarily reported.;It is at this point that the action and report envisaged in the present Cornell papyrus. Accompanied by three recognised surveyros ("geometrai"), the peasant owner or tenant had measured the "chersos" and "adespotos" portions of his plots which the goverment had designated as probably transferable to the classification of "basilike ge sporime". Note that in all these cases the landmeasurer had meantime "found" that the land was seed land. Three village officials accompanied the peasant owner or tenant and the three surveyors. These were the boundary official ("oriodeiktes"), the village headman ("meizon tes komes") and the village chief ("komarches"). Upon agreement reached by them the tenant declared under imperial oath the amount of his land which was to be transferred from the classification of ownerless goverment land to the higher production category of "royal seedd land" (with higher rate of rent) or from the category of private dry land to that of private seed land (with corresponding increase in the land tax).;Egypt had been the scene of serious disturbance during the suppression of the revolt of L.Domitius Domitianus (Achilleus) in A.D. 295-296 A.D. In A.D. 302 the situation was so acute that Diocletian diverted a part of the grain which normally went to Rome for the relief of Alexandria. For the census of the year 302 special inducements must have been offred to the peasants to take abandoned goverment land. The nature of these inducements we cannot know.

"summary","text","The document contains eleven declarations of land for the census of the year 302 A.D. All are of the same day (Thoth 26), this being the date preserved in five of the eleven columns, with a portion of the date in other columns. The eleven declarations are from Karanis, Arsinoe and Ptolemais Nea, but the plots declared are without exception about the village of Ptolemais Nea. The head of the census is the same Septimius Sabinus who had charge of the work in that none five years earlier (see P.Corn. 19 = P.Corn. inv. no II 30).;The census was instituted in accordance with an imperial decree which was sent abroad over Egypt by order of the catholicos, at that time being Valerius Euethius. The first step was a declaration made by landowners and landholders to the censitor of all the taxable land held by them. In our document the primary declaration had been made a short time before, as appears from the phrase "apo tes apographeises up' emou proen epi Sabeino kensitori". The next move was taken by the goverment officials. The land reported as "chersos" or "adespotos" was checked over by the bureau of the landmeasurer ("anametretes"). In our document this occured in the month Thoth at the height of the flood season. The investigation was designed to determine what amount of the land reported by individuals as "dry" or "ownerless" should actually be classified as seed land ("en spora" or "sporime ge"). The peasant landowner or landlord was held responsible both for correct measurement and for declaration of the gain of the goverment resulting from the substitution of "seed land" for the "dry" and "tenantless" amounts primarily reported.;It is at this point that the action and report envisaged in the present Cornell papyrus. Accompanied by three recognised surveyros ("geometrai"), the peasant owner or tenant had measured the "chersos" and "adespotos" portions of his plots which the goverment had designated as probably transferable to the classification of "basilike ge sporime". Note that in all these cases the landmeasurer had meantime "found" that the land was seed land. Three village officials accompanied the peasant owner or tenant and the three surveyors. These were the boundary official ("oriodeiktes"), the village headman ("meizon tes komes") and the village chief ("komarches"). Upon agreement reached by them the tenant declared under imperial oath the amount of his land which was to be transferred from the classification of ownerless goverment land to the higher production category of "royal seedd land" (with higher rate of rent) or from the category of private dry land to that of private seed land (with corresponding increase in the land tax).;Egypt had been the scene of serious disturbance during the suppression of the revolt of L.Domitius Domitianus (Achilleus) in A.D. 295-296 A.D. In A.D. 302 the situation was so acute that Diocletian diverted a part of the grain which normally went to Rome for the relief of Alexandria. For the census of the year 302 special inducements must have been offred to the peasants to take abandoned goverment land. The nature of these inducements we cannot know. Their results, hoever, are apparent in this census roll.","",""

"summary","text","The document contains eleven declarations of land for the census of the year 302 A.D. All are of the same day (Thoth 26), this being the date preserved in five of the eleven columns, with a portion of the date in other columns. The eleven declarations are from Karanis, Arsinoe and Ptolemais Nea, but the plots declared are without exception about the village of Ptolemais Nea. The head of the census is the same Septimius Sabinus who had charge of the work in that none five years earlier (see P.Corn. 19 = P.Corn. inv. no II 30).;The census was instituted in accordance with an imperial decree which was sent abroad over Egypt by order of the catholicos, at that time being Valerius Euethius. The first step was a declaration made by landowners and landholders to the censitor of all the taxable land held by them. In our document the primary declaration had been made a short time before, as appears from the phrase "apo tes apographeises up' emou proen epi Sabeino kensitori". The next move was taken by the goverment officials. The land reported as "chersos" or "adespotos" was checked over by the bureau of the landmeasurer ("anametretes"). In our document this occured in the month Thoth at the height of the flood season. The investigation was designed to determine what amount of the land reported by individuals as "dry" or "ownerless" should actually be classified as seed land ("en spora" or "sporime ge"). The peasant landowner or landlord was held responsible both for correct measurement and for declaration of the gain of the goverment resulting from the substitution of "seed land" for the "dry" and "tenantless" amounts primarily reported.;It is at this point that the action and report envisaged in the present Cornell papyrus. Accompanied by three recognised surveyros ("geometrai"), the peasant owner or tenant had measured the "chersos" and "adespotos" portions of his plots which the goverment had designated as probably transferable to the classification of "basilike ge sporime". Note that in all these cases the landmeasurer had meantime "found" that the land was seed land. Three village officials accompanied the peasant owner or tenant and the three surveyors. These were the boundary official ("oriodeiktes"), the village headman ("meizon tes komes") and the village chief ("komarches"). Upon agreement reached by them the tenant declared under imperial oath the amount of his land which was to be transferred from the classification of ownerless goverment land to the higher production category of "royal seedd land" (with higher rate of rent) or from the category of private dry land to that of private seed land (with corresponding increase in the land tax).;Egypt had been the scene of serious disturbance during the suppression of the revolt of L.Domitius Domitianus (Achilleus) in A.D. 295-296 A.D. In A.D. 302 the situation was so acute that Diocletian diverted a part of the grain which normally went to Rome for the relief of Alexandria. For the census of the year 302 special inducements must have been offred to the peasants to take abandoned goverment land. The nature of these inducements we cannot know. Their results, hoever, are apparent in this census roll.","",""

"ab","text","(Col. I);;[- - -] . . . Of the fore parts the sphere of the Sun [should be considered] first, for [Saturn and the Sun have] the smallest variation in latitude; it is, then, in size 2 1/2×, that is, 150', for the degree contains 60'; the moon's is 6×, or 360'; that of Saturn 10×, or 600'; that of Jupiter 13× 45'; next, Mercury's sphere is 21× 15' or 1275'; and the sphere of Mars is 42×, or 2520'. The sphere of Venus is the largest, exceeding the breadth of the circle of the zodiac, in which the divinity is exalted and depressed; her sphere, then, is 48× or 2880'. Such is the circuit of their orbits; and by this . . .;;(Col. II) [- - -] . . . they come to apogee and have least apparent motion. Then standing still they begin to turn back . . . to the eye seeming . . . and they seem to move (the faster?) by as much as they are seen to . . ., and with accelerated movement . . . left behind by the Sun on their downward circuit they reach their own spheres. After this they come to perigee and have their greatest apparent motion. Thus the height and the breadth of their epicycles are the cause of the anomaly in their course, for their daily motion is always the same, that of the Sun 59' 8'' 16''', of the Moon 13 whole degrees and 10', of Saturn 2', of Jupiter 5', of Mars 32', and of Venus and Mercury the same as the Sun. These latter two, however, differ from the Sun by reason of their epicycles; for though they have a daily motion that is equal to the Sun's their movement in height and in breadth is not equal to his; but when they get farther south or farther north than the Sun they seem to make retrogressions, or they are passed by the Sun and stand fixed; or they are depressed and run ahead of the Sun. At such times Venus seems to run 5' {5'} <read: 35'>, so as to move more swiftly than the Sun, and Mercury 3× 6', that is, 186'. Since such is their order, [one may] in accordance with the epicycles of each one of them select a portion and by those measures assign it to each, both from the forward parts of the image and from the backward parts. Of the 2880' of Venus, then, one-third is 960' . . .;;(Col. III);[- - -] . . . Next in order, of the 6 1/2× of the Moon, one-third is 2 1/6×, that is, 130'; accordingly at this one hundred thirtieth point the must mark out the Moon's portion. It will extend to the tip of the chin. The visage is the most wonderful part of the image. Thus the whole head is the tabernacle of the Sun and the Moon, but he controls the faculty of knowledge, and she that of change and of affection; and from Mercury comes the faculty of thought, but from the Sum the directive faculty; but the faculty of interpretation is attached to the portion of the Moon, tongue, mouth and speech. For this reason this section is related to each of the sectae and is not far removed from the leader, the Sun. Accordingly, as in man the face is most remarkable for its changes and the affections that occur to it, so the Moon, in the universe, is remarkable for its changes of colors and for its illuminations and emanations. The Moon alone aids the . . . accepting . . . ten times in the course of the year . . . and paying back its waxings and wanings through a period of 28 days . . . And the face is the grace . . . and the Sun . . . the changes most proper to it . . .;;(Col. IV);[- - -] . . . The epicycle of Jupiter measures 13× 45', which is 825', of which one-third is 275'. Accordingly at the two hundred seventy-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Jupiter. It includes the breast as far as the stomach and the liver, in which reside fire, the mental faculty, and the appetitive faculty because the conversion into blood of the food which is introduced into the body is performed by the liver. It is for just this reason that the faculty of command is assigned to this portion; for truly the leader takes forethought for the state as the liver does for the body. If indeed the region of the liver becomes diseased, the whole body immediately becomes jaundiced or dropsical and like a corpse, because the blood is not properly managed. Therefore such things come to mankind from Jupiter, and therefore also the omens are observed in the livers of the victims by those who perform sacrifices, and appetites for food and sexual intercourse come from the liver. For from its entrance a broad vessel reaches to the seminal regions, and thus, of the food, a part is made into blood and distributed to the veins and part is divided off into that vessel and becomes semen. For this reason the testicles are on either side. For the sake of this also . . . applied to Zeus the epither "of many offspring"; and within . . . Next in order the epicycle of Mercury measures 21× 15', or 1275'; one-third of the epicycle is 425'. Accordingly at the four hundred twenty-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Mercury . . .;;(Col. V);[- - -] . . . And next the epicycle of Mars measures 42× or 2520', one-third of which is 840'; so at the eight hundred fortieth point we must mark off the portion of Mars. t will include the hands from the wrists, the pubes, the genital organs, the thighs and knees, and will end at the shins. For this reason the principle of the seed is naturally aroused in the period of Mars, who returns to his original position every 15 years; so at that time boys show signs of manhood, their voices break and they show the outward signs of puberty according to the times which the fates may hold for them; for in some cases they will be found to bring it about in 12 years, in some in 13, in some in 14, in some in 15, and in some in 16 or a little more; for these things come about in consequence of the ascensions of the Sun. From Mars indeed come manhood and the impulse to arms, from about the fifteenth year; for this reason boys are given the Olympic crown even in the twelfth year, in the zodiacal period of Jupiter, but they do not bear arms unless the period of Mars, 15 years, has been fulfilled. Castrations, the cutting off of the genital organs, the changes of women, and abortions come from Mars; and further, both incontinence and virginity are within his province, when he is moved in a certain way - about which things I have spoken in the book on the influences of the stars. Again, the breaking of thighs, the wrenching of knees, and the bruising and wounding of the shins are from Mars.;The last epicycle, which brings to an end the forward parts of the image, is that of Venus, measuring 48× or 2880', and one-third of this is 960'. The portion of Venus is from the shins to the toe nails . . .;;(Col. VI);[- - -] . . . the 840' are also slavish . . . below this we must assign 50' to the Sun as his portion. It will reach to the neck, which portion we assigned to the Sun as leader and master; then are assigned . . . fostered by the Sun somewhat in this manner; for these affections are from above. But at 130' we must mark off the portion of the Moon; and it will include the calves; and somehow, whenever we see a noteworthy face, we go around and straightway see the calf of the leg, since naturally the portion of the Moon which is akin to it leads us all to this. Afflictions, fractures, and amputations of the legs come about through the Moon's influence. Then to 200' is the portion of Saturn, the back of the knees and extremities of the hams of ever wearied men. Then to 275' is the portion of Jupiter; the hams; hence beloved boys and those who are well adapted for the practice are led to these courses through the influence of Jupiter; Ganymede serves to express this in mythology for those whose courses are natural.. And at 425' we must mark off the portion of Mercury; it will include the buttocks to the hip-joints and a little higher. This region also aids the belly and is impure. Accordingly when people have a base disease and suffer unnaturally, if it be against their will and consent, then it will be found that in the genitures of these men Venus is injured in these daemonic degrees of Mercury; but if it is by their own devices the star of Mercury will be found injured in these same degrees. The rest belongs to Mars as far as the middle of the neck; for the neck is divided; at that point the 840' ends. For the whole head belongs to the Sun and the Moon, but of the neck the forward part belongs to Saturn and the back to Mars; for this reason . . . bear on their backs.;;(Col. VII);[- - -] . . . as far as the last degree of Aries increasing . . . if it be found . . . from the first degree of Leo. Count the degrees until you come to the degree of the star and take one-third of the number, and if it is less than 16, the star is in dominant degrees, but if more than what they are up to Capricornus and away from Taurus. So must you do: if the star os fpimd om these quadrants between the first degree and the remainder of the quadrant up to the last degree, you must observe and take one-third of it and similarly observe whether the discovered number is more or less than 16. So that what I say may be easier and readier to understand, thus shall it be known: from 1× of Leo to 18× of Virgo there are fulfilled three times 16, of the fore parts, and from 1× [of Aquarius] to 18× [of Pisces] similarly; and again, from 12× [of Gemini] to 30× of Cancer, and from 12× [of Sagittarius] to 30× of Capricorn. The degrees of the forward parts are 48 altogether. And from 18× of Virgo [to 30× of Libra and from 18× of Pisces to 30× of Aries is 42×; and from 1× of Taurus to 12× of Gemini, as well as from 1×óof Scorpio to 12× of Sagittarius, is 42×]. And they all belong to the external degrees and hinder parts.;And these are likewise the true and natural termini of the seven gods, the peculiar possessions of each several one of them. For example, [from 1× of Leo and Aquarius to 2 1/2× is the terminus of the Sun, and from] 2 1/2× of Leo and Aquarius to 6 1/2× is the terminus of the Moon; from 6 1/2× to 10×, of Saturn; from 10× to 13× 45' of Jupiter; from 13× 45' to 24× 15' of Mercury; from 24× 15' of Leo to 12× of Virgo, and from 24× 15' of Aquarius to 12× [of Pisces], of Mars; and from 12× of Virgo [and of Pisces] to 18× of Virgo and of Pisces belongs to Venus. These are dominant [degrees]. Again, from 12× of Gemini and 12× of Sagittarius to 14 1/2× of Gemini and 14 1/2× of Sagittarius belongs to the Sun; these termini are dominant degrees up to 18× of the two signs; to 22× of the two signs is the property of Saturn . . .;;(Col. VIII);[- - -] . . . and from 18× of Virgo and Pisces to 20 1/2× of both signs is the terminus of the Sun, daemonic; from 20 1/2× of both signs to 24 1/2× is the Moon's terminus; from 241 /2× of both signs to 28× is the terminus of Saturn; [from 28×] of both to 1× 45' of Libra and Aries to [14× 15' of Libra and Aries is the terminus of Mercury; and from 14× 15' of both signs to 30× of Libra and] Aries is the terminus of MArs, daemonic. Again, from 1× of Scorpio and of Taurus to 12× of Sagittarius [and of Gemini] is the terminus of Mars. Thus let these termini be marked out.;There are two sects, of night and day, of the Sun and [of the Moon], and the Sun rules the day and the Moon runs the night. Saturn and Jupiter are the bodyguards of the Sun, Mars and Venus of the Moon; Mercury belongs to the Moon by night and to the Sun by day. Whenever, then, it is needful to test a star so must you test it. In diurnal genitures . . . let the [diurnal] star be found within the 16×, [and the nocturnal] outside of them; and in nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars be found within and the diurnal outside of the 16×; for the reverse is evil. And preferably let the lords of the houses of the luminaries and the masters of the centers and the lords of the loci be found upon the numbers; for greater happiness results; and preferably let the sects be performing their own proper acts; for the exchange of properties between the sects is fatal.;There are seven significant signs, the horoscope, the fourth from it, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. Let, therefore, the stars that form the geniture be ruling their houses in the significant signs, and so let them be found, for this is best. Andf let the diurnal stars be at the diurnal centers not only in terms of signs, but also of degrees, or let them be moving toward the centers, and let the nocturnal stars be retreating. But in the nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars;;(Col. IX);be at the nocturnal centers in terms of signs and degrees . . . their advance is hostile . . . if at night, the Moon. And by day let the Sun abide in a masculine sign, by night, the Moon. By day let Saturn be at the horoscope or zenith, standing in some relation to the geniture; by night similarly Mars; for the reverse is bad, particularly if they are not sympathetic to the geniture.;The centers are called horoscope, zenith, occident, nadir. The second from the horoscope is Hope; the third Friends and Goddess; the fourth Foundation, Base, Resource; the fifth Good Fortune; the sixth Daemonie; the seventh Sign of Death; the eighth Inactive; the Ninth Defection and Region of Strange Land; the tenth Accomplishment; the eleventh Good Daemon; [the twelfth Evil Daemon]. Now according to Asclepius the subjects of the inquiry are thus arranged; from the horoscope questions of length of life are to be sought; from the second in the upward direction, livelihood; from the third, brothers; from the fourth, parents; from the fifth, children; from the sixth, injury or suffering; from the seventh, wife; from the eighth, fortune and death that puts a bound to all, according to the lords of these houses. We, however, seek from the horoscope length of life and peculiarities of soul, from the Sun father, patrimony, leaders, and the senses; from the Moon mother, maternal endowment, and body; from Saturn the confirmation of every written instrument, evil or good, and benefit from inheritances from elders and from the death of outsiders, and crops from the earth; from Jupiter offices, preisthoods, knowledge, children, wealth; from Mars, brothers, and arts of violence carried out by means of fire and iron. Injury comes from Mars, Saturn and the horoscope; by day . . . from Saturn to Mars . . .;;(Col. X);[- - -] . . . [we inquire about] death from the descending sign, and call it the Theme of Death; and in all the book on planetary effects . . . But now we must speak of the phases of the stars or about the Sun's rising and setting . . . And the motion of the planets thus brings about in the case of Mercury and Venus the occasions of their being left behind or running ahead, and in the case of the three remaining planets their stations and retrogressions. Now when the Sun runs 15× away from the stars, the stars rise and exercise especial power upon genitures. Mars is an excessively evil influence at rising until he has escaped from the hostile fire of the Sun. Mercury again overtakes the Sun only after having been left 22× behind him; for as he descends his sphere he comes closer to the earth; but when Venus has been left 48× behind and has stood still, she descends her own proper sphere and overtakes the Sun. Thereafter, being the more depressed, they again precede him by the same distance, and when they have been elevated on their spheres they have their evening stations. Then they are again overtaken by him and within the 15× their concealments take place. The stars are in concord with their effects . . .;;(Col. XI);[- - -] . . . when they stand still they are powerful in their proper effects. But the three stars rising in opposition to the Sun move, preceding the Sun and removed from him by 15×; they come to a standstill when they are 120× away from him and are powerful in their influences; when they are 180× away and are in opposition to him they make their western evening rising and still retreat; then they turn backward in their course and are unfavorable to their own effects; then for the second time they stand still; and at the first [of their station] their significance is good, but at the end evil. Now they await the Sun, and stand still when the sun is 120× distant from them. Then they are concealed and are divergent from their effects. But Mars besides has two other phases, the ninety-day anomalies, when he is in the sextile aspect to the Sun; and in the first he is strongly maleficent and makes evil those who have their nativities at the time; but in the second [he makes] them daring, bold, evildoers and robbers caught in the act; then coming toward him the Sun is in the sexitle aspect to him.;These are called their configurations and phases. There are four configurations of the Sun, two equinoxes in the eighth degree of Aries and of Libra, and two solstices, the summer, in the eighth degree of Cancer, and the winter in the eighth degree of Capricorn. Of the Moon there are preeminently four configurations: conjunction, when it is unseen(?); first half-moon, when it is seven days old; full moon, when it is fourteen; second half-moon when it is twenty-one. The Moon looses the bonds of longitude and latitude in seven-day periods, but the Sun at the solstitial and equinoctial degrees.;The signs, because of the obliquity of the circle, do not ascend in equal periods, but vary in seven different regions or climes. For in the Ethiopic clime Aries ascends in twenty-two periods and Libra in thirty-eight, in which the amount to be added is 2 2/3; in the Syrian clime Aries ascends in twenty-one and Libra in thirty-nine periods, and the amount to be added or subtracted is 3. In the Rhodian clime [Aries ascends] in twenty and Libra in forty periods, and the amount added or subtracted is 3 1/3; in the clime of Asia and Ionia Aries ascends in nineteen and Libra in forty-one, wherein the amount added or subtracted is 3 2/3; in the clime of Argos;;(Col. XII);Aries ascends in eighteeen [and Libra in forty-two, and the amount] added [is 4]; in the clime of Rome and Italy and maritime Gaul Aries ascends [in seventeen and] Libra in forty-three, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 1/3; in . . ., Germany and [Britain] Aries ascends [in sixteen] and Libra in forty-four, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 2/3. Now in every clime Cancer and Capricornus ascend in thirty periods; fifteen periods equal one equinoctial hour, and the period is of primary importance with reference to life.;For the rest, of the signs of the zodiac some hear one another, some see one another, and some perceive one another. Those that hear one another are the ones beginning with the equinoctial signs which are equally distant from them, and their degrees hear each other's degrees and the signs the signs. For since day does not see night because it is diametrically opposite to it, equal night hears equal day. Whenever night is completed in equal hours with the day, the signs also hear one another in periods of time; for the day in Taurus is thirteen hours, when the Sun passes through Pisces or Taurus. Gemini and Aquarius hear each other; for when the Sun is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and when he is in Aquarius the night is fourteen hours. Cancer and Capricornus also are to one another in the relation of hearing, but they are prevented by the Earth intervening between them. Leo and Sagittarius hear one another, and similarly Virgo and Scorpio, but Libra and Aries do not. Equal day looks upon, but does not hear, equal day; so the ten signs beginning with the tropical signs and equally distant on either side look upon one another; as, for instance, Leo and Gemini; for when the Sun is in Leo and similarly when he is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and the night ten. Similarly Taurus and Virgo look upon one another, then Libra and Aries, then Scorpio and Pisces, then Sagittarius and Aquarius; Capricornus and Cancer, however, have the seeing relation one to another but are thrust apart because of the Earth intervening between them; and no other sign rises where Capricorn rises or where Cancer rises. Thus without seeing each other they rise from these places with no sign looking upon them. For this reason these signs alone cast shadows outside, while the Sun is passing through the signs that look upon one another. Wherefore admittedly day looks upon day. But these signs which perceive one another are the dwelling places of the stars, as Cancer and Leo, Virgo ;;(Col. XIII);[and Gemini, Taurus and Libra, Scorpio and Aries, Pisces and Sagittarius, Capricornus and Aquarius - - -] . . . and the double-bodied, Gemini, Virgo, [Sagittarius, and Pisces . . .] the tropical signs . . . the double-bodied belong to Mercury and Jupiter . . . [- - -] . . . they are called "solid" because of the "solid" signs each one is set aside for a single element . . . [- - -] . . . they are called eccentricities because the earth is the central point of the universe, and is the midmost of the seven planets. Still other ethereal constellations revolve in their own circles. The Sun is in apogee in Gemini; Venus is in perigee in Pisces and in apogee in Virgo; Jupiter is in apogee in Cancer and in perigee in Capricorn . . .;;(Col. XIV-XV: too fragmentary to be translated);;(Col. XVI);[- - -] . . . Hippocrates testified; for he called the Sun Daemon and the Moon Fortune. Leo is a male sign and Cancer female; and to the five gods that move together nature has assigned houses in pairs, a male and a female. For the Sun holds dominion by day, and the Moon by night, and these both by day and by night serve the two kings; and the signs inhabited by them are the vitals of the universe. To Mercury was given the first section, that beneath Leo and Cancer, in which are Virgo and Gemini, female and male. To Venus the zone beneath this, in which are Libra and Taurus, male and female. To Mars the zone beneath this, in which are Scorpio and Aries, female and male. To Jupiter the zone beneath this, in which are Sagittarius and Pisces, male and female. To Saturn the zone over all, Capricornus and Aquarius, female and male. Thus also from these regions they stand guard over the Moon and the Sun. In these signs the stars have their own powers and are vigorous. And nature assigned them thrones and prisons; their thrones the signs upon which they are exalted and have royal power and prisons wherein they are depressed and oppose their own powers. The [throne of the Sun] is at 19× of Aries, [his prison in Libra. The Moon's throne] us 3× of Taurus, [her prison 3× of Scorpio]. Saturn's [throne is 21× of Libra, his prison in Aries. The throne of Jupiter is 15×] of Cancer, his prison 15× [of Capricornus]. The throne of Mars [is 28× of Capricornus and his prison 28] of Cancer. [The throne of] Venus [is 27× of Pisces,] her prison [27× of Virgo].;;(Col. XVII);[- - -] . . . and in Libra, Aquarius and Gemini . . . In Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus the Moon, Venus and Mercury rejoice, and in part Mars, but he does not take part in the governorship because the trianle belongs to similar gods as masters. In Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer Mars and Venus rejoice, and the Moon shares the triangle as well, but does not take part in the governorship by day. This is the order of the houses and exaltations. . . . [Hermes] observed the stars, among the signs of the zodiac, in the degrees from the first of Leo to the thirtieth of Libra increasing, from 1× of Aquarius to 30× of Aries moving . . . in elevation and latitude, and from 1× of Scorpio to 30× of Capricornus and from 1× of Taurus to 30× of Cancer diminishing, and from equal diminishing quadrants he observed the motion of the universal heavenly bodies becoming . . . He observed that the 360× hold significance for the universe; wherefore the universe is itself imperishable . . . For it moves . . . and equal increment and subtraction . . .;;(Col. XVIII);[- - -] . . . they rejoice in the signs before their own exaltations, and affording complete effects . . . perfect; but they are afflicted in the signs following their own exaltations. For the stars depart from their own exaltations and begin to be depressed; they do not rejoice when they are in opposition tro one another unless they exchange houses. The planets of opposite sects are more harmful when in opposition. The maleficent planets are most prone to injure in the quartile aspect and in opposition, but are harmless in trine. The beneficient planets in trine are most beneficial, in the quartile aspect or in opposition less effective. The triangles that come about when the Sun is in trine with respect to the Moon are sure in their effects but the quartile aspect and opposition are not. . . . [- - -] . . . in the quartile aspect or in opposition to the Moon when it is becoming full signifies insecurity, great and bloody dangers; and in quartile aspect to the waning Moon . . . is especially significant of insecurity and danger . . .;;(Col.

"ab","text","(Col. I);;[- - -] . . . Of the fore parts the sphere of the Sun [should be considered] first, for [Saturn and the Sun have] the smallest variation in latitude; it is, then, in size 2 1/2×, that is, 150', for the degree contains 60'; the moon's is 6×, or 360'; that of Saturn 10×, or 600'; that of Jupiter 13× 45'; next, Mercury's sphere is 21× 15' or 1275'; and the sphere of Mars is 42×, or 2520'. The sphere of Venus is the largest, exceeding the breadth of the circle of the zodiac, in which the divinity is exalted and depressed; her sphere, then, is 48× or 2880'. Such is the circuit of their orbits; and by this . . .;;(Col. II) [- - -] . . . they come to apogee and have least apparent motion. Then standing still they begin to turn back . . . to the eye seeming . . . and they seem to move (the faster?) by as much as they are seen to . . ., and with accelerated movement . . . left behind by the Sun on their downward circuit they reach their own spheres. After this they come to perigee and have their greatest apparent motion. Thus the height and the breadth of their epicycles are the cause of the anomaly in their course, for their daily motion is always the same, that of the Sun 59' 8'' 16''', of the Moon 13 whole degrees and 10', of Saturn 2', of Jupiter 5', of Mars 32', and of Venus and Mercury the same as the Sun. These latter two, however, differ from the Sun by reason of their epicycles; for though they have a daily motion that is equal to the Sun's their movement in height and in breadth is not equal to his; but when they get farther south or farther north than the Sun they seem to make retrogressions, or they are passed by the Sun and stand fixed; or they are depressed and run ahead of the Sun. At such times Venus seems to run 5' {5'} <read: 35'>, so as to move more swiftly than the Sun, and Mercury 3× 6', that is, 186'. Since such is their order, [one may] in accordance with the epicycles of each one of them select a portion and by those measures assign it to each, both from the forward parts of the image and from the backward parts. Of the 2880' of Venus, then, one-third is 960' . . .;;(Col. III);[- - -] . . . Next in order, of the 6 1/2× of the Moon, one-third is 2 1/6×, that is, 130'; accordingly at this one hundred thirtieth point the must mark out the Moon's portion. It will extend to the tip of the chin. The visage is the most wonderful part of the image. Thus the whole head is the tabernacle of the Sun and the Moon, but he controls the faculty of knowledge, and she that of change and of affection; and from Mercury comes the faculty of thought, but from the Sum the directive faculty; but the faculty of interpretation is attached to the portion of the Moon, tongue, mouth and speech. For this reason this section is related to each of the sectae and is not far removed from the leader, the Sun. Accordingly, as in man the face is most remarkable for its changes and the affections that occur to it, so the Moon, in the universe, is remarkable for its changes of colors and for its illuminations and emanations. The Moon alone aids the . . . accepting . . . ten times in the course of the year . . . and paying back its waxings and wanings through a period of 28 days . . . And the face is the grace . . . and the Sun . . . the changes most proper to it . . .;;(Col. IV);[- - -] . . . The epicycle of Jupiter measures 13× 45', which is 825', of which one-third is 275'. Accordingly at the two hundred seventy-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Jupiter. It includes the breast as far as the stomach and the liver, in which reside fire, the mental faculty, and the appetitive faculty because the conversion into blood of the food which is introduced into the body is performed by the liver. It is for just this reason that the faculty of command is assigned to this portion; for truly the leader takes forethought for the state as the liver does for the body. If indeed the region of the liver becomes diseased, the whole body immediately becomes jaundiced or dropsical and like a corpse, because the blood is not properly managed. Therefore such things come to mankind from Jupiter, and therefore also the omens are observed in the livers of the victims by those who perform sacrifices, and appetites for food and sexual intercourse come from the liver. For from its entrance a broad vessel reaches to the seminal regions, and thus, of the food, a part is made into blood and distributed to the veins and part is divided off into that vessel and becomes semen. For this reason the testicles are on either side. For the sake of this also . . . applied to Zeus the epither "of many offspring"; and within . . . Next in order the epicycle of Mercury measures 21× 15', or 1275'; one-third of the epicycle is 425'. Accordingly at the four hundred twenty-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Mercury . . .;;(Col. V);[- - -] . . . And next the epicycle of Mars measures 42× or 2520', one-third of which is 840'; so at the eight hundred fortieth point we must mark off the portion of Mars. t will include the hands from the wrists, the pubes, the genital organs, the thighs and knees, and will end at the shins. For this reason the principle of the seed is naturally aroused in the period of Mars, who returns to his original position every 15 years; so at that time boys show signs of manhood, their voices break and they show the outward signs of puberty according to the times which the fates may hold for them; for in some cases they will be found to bring it about in 12 years, in some in 13, in some in 14, in some in 15, and in some in 16 or a little more; for these things come about in consequence of the ascensions of the Sun. From Mars indeed come manhood and the impulse to arms, from about the fifteenth year; for this reason boys are given the Olympic crown even in the twelfth year, in the zodiacal period of Jupiter, but they do not bear arms unless the period of Mars, 15 years, has been fulfilled. Castrations, the cutting off of the genital organs, the changes of women, and abortions come from Mars; and further, both incontinence and virginity are within his province, when he is moved in a certain way - about which things I have spoken in the book on the influences of the stars. Again, the breaking of thighs, the wrenching of knees, and the bruising and wounding of the shins are from Mars.;The last epicycle, which brings to an end the forward parts of the image, is that of Venus, measuring 48× or 2880', and one-third of this is 960'. The portion of Venus is from the shins to the toe nails . . .;;(Col. VI);[- - -] . . . the 840' are also slavish . . . below this we must assign 50' to the Sun as his portion. It will reach to the neck, which portion we assigned to the Sun as leader and master; then are assigned . . . fostered by the Sun somewhat in this manner; for these affections are from above. But at 130' we must mark off the portion of the Moon; and it will include the calves; and somehow, whenever we see a noteworthy face, we go around and straightway see the calf of the leg, since naturally the portion of the Moon which is akin to it leads us all to this. Afflictions, fractures, and amputations of the legs come about through the Moon's influence. Then to 200' is the portion of Saturn, the back of the knees and extremities of the hams of ever wearied men. Then to 275' is the portion of Jupiter; the hams; hence beloved boys and those who are well adapted for the practice are led to these courses through the influence of Jupiter; Ganymede serves to express this in mythology for those whose courses are natural.. And at 425' we must mark off the portion of Mercury; it will include the buttocks to the hip-joints and a little higher. This region also aids the belly and is impure. Accordingly when people have a base disease and suffer unnaturally, if it be against their will and consent, then it will be found that in the genitures of these men Venus is injured in these daemonic degrees of Mercury; but if it is by their own devices the star of Mercury will be found injured in these same degrees. The rest belongs to Mars as far as the middle of the neck; for the neck is divided; at that point the 840' ends. For the whole head belongs to the Sun and the Moon, but of the neck the forward part belongs to Saturn and the back to Mars; for this reason . . . bear on their backs.;;(Col. VII);[- - -] . . . as far as the last degree of Aries increasing . . . if it be found . . . from the first degree of Leo. Count the degrees until you come to the degree of the star and take one-third of the number, and if it is less than 16, the star is in dominant degrees, but if more than what they are up to Capricornus and away from Taurus. So must you do: if the star os fpimd om these quadrants between the first degree and the remainder of the quadrant up to the last degree, you must observe and take one-third of it and similarly observe whether the discovered number is more or less than 16. So that what I say may be easier and readier to understand, thus shall it be known: from 1× of Leo to 18× of Virgo there are fulfilled three times 16, of the fore parts, and from 1× [of Aquarius] to 18× [of Pisces] similarly; and again, from 12× [of Gemini] to 30× of Cancer, and from 12× [of Sagittarius] to 30× of Capricorn. The degrees of the forward parts are 48 altogether. And from 18× of Virgo [to 30× of Libra and from 18× of Pisces to 30× of Aries is 42×; and from 1× of Taurus to 12× of Gemini, as well as from 1×óof Scorpio to 12× of Sagittarius, is 42×]. And they all belong to the external degrees and hinder parts.;And these are likewise the true and natural termini of the seven gods, the peculiar possessions of each several one of them. For example, [from 1× of Leo and Aquarius to 2 1/2× is the terminus of the Sun, and from] 2 1/2× of Leo and Aquarius to 6 1/2× is the terminus of the Moon; from 6 1/2× to 10×, of Saturn; from 10× to 13× 45' of Jupiter; from 13× 45' to 24× 15' of Mercury; from 24× 15' of Leo to 12× of Virgo, and from 24× 15' of Aquarius to 12× [of Pisces], of Mars; and from 12× of Virgo [and of Pisces] to 18× of Virgo and of Pisces belongs to Venus. These are dominant [degrees]. Again, from 12× of Gemini and 12× of Sagittarius to 14 1/2× of Gemini and 14 1/2× of Sagittarius belongs to the Sun; these termini are dominant degrees up to 18× of the two signs; to 22× of the two signs is the property of Saturn . . .;;(Col. VIII);[- - -] . . . and from 18× of Virgo and Pisces to 20 1/2× of both signs is the terminus of the Sun, daemonic; from 20 1/2× of both signs to 24 1/2× is the Moon's terminus; from 241 /2× of both signs to 28× is the terminus of Saturn; [from 28×] of both to 1× 45' of Libra and Aries to [14× 15' of Libra and Aries is the terminus of Mercury; and from 14× 15' of both signs to 30× of Libra and] Aries is the terminus of MArs, daemonic. Again, from 1× of Scorpio and of Taurus to 12× of Sagittarius [and of Gemini] is the terminus of Mars. Thus let these termini be marked out.;There are two sects, of night and day, of the Sun and [of the Moon], and the Sun rules the day and the Moon runs the night. Saturn and Jupiter are the bodyguards of the Sun, Mars and Venus of the Moon; Mercury belongs to the Moon by night and to the Sun by day. Whenever, then, it is needful to test a star so must you test it. In diurnal genitures . . . let the [diurnal] star be found within the 16×, [and the nocturnal] outside of them; and in nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars be found within and the diurnal outside of the 16×; for the reverse is evil. And preferably let the lords of the houses of the luminaries and the masters of the centers and the lords of the loci be found upon the numbers; for greater happiness results; and preferably let the sects be performing their own proper acts; for the exchange of properties between the sects is fatal.;There are seven significant signs, the horoscope, the fourth from it, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. Let, therefore, the stars that form the geniture be ruling their houses in the significant signs, and so let them be found, for this is best. Andf let the diurnal stars be at the diurnal centers not only in terms of signs, but also of degrees, or let them be moving toward the centers, and let the nocturnal stars be retreating. But in the nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars;;(Col. IX);be at the nocturnal centers in terms of signs and degrees . . . their advance is hostile . . . if at night, the Moon. And by day let the Sun abide in a masculine sign, by night, the Moon. By day let Saturn be at the horoscope or zenith, standing in some relation to the geniture; by night similarly Mars; for the reverse is bad, particularly if they are not sympathetic to the geniture.;The centers are called horoscope, zenith, occident, nadir. The second from the horoscope is Hope; the third Friends and Goddess; the fourth Foundation, Base, Resource; the fifth Good Fortune; the sixth Daemonie; the seventh Sign of Death; the eighth Inactive; the Ninth Defection and Region of Strange Land; the tenth Accomplishment; the eleventh Good Daemon; [the twelfth Evil Daemon]. Now according to Asclepius the subjects of the inquiry are thus arranged; from the horoscope questions of length of life are to be sought; from the second in the upward direction, livelihood; from the third, brothers; from the fourth, parents; from the fifth, children; from the sixth, injury or suffering; from the seventh, wife; from the eighth, fortune and death that puts a bound to all, according to the lords of these houses. We, however, seek from the horoscope length of life and peculiarities of soul, from the Sun father, patrimony, leaders, and the senses; from the Moon mother, maternal endowment, and body; from Saturn the confirmation of every written instrument, evil or good, and benefit from inheritances from elders and from the death of outsiders, and crops from the earth; from Jupiter offices, preisthoods, knowledge, children, wealth; from Mars, brothers, and arts of violence carried out by means of fire and iron. Injury comes from Mars, Saturn and the horoscope; by day . . . from Saturn to Mars . . .;;(Col. X);[- - -] . . . [we inquire about] death from the descending sign, and call it the Theme of Death; and in all the book on planetary effects . . . But now we must speak of the phases of the stars or about the Sun's rising and setting . . . And the motion of the planets thus brings about in the case of Mercury and Venus the occasions of their being left behind or running ahead, and in the case of the three remaining planets their stations and retrogressions. Now when the Sun runs 15× away from the stars, the stars rise and exercise especial power upon genitures. Mars is an excessively evil influence at rising until he has escaped from the hostile fire of the Sun. Mercury again overtakes the Sun only after having been left 22× behind him; for as he descends his sphere he comes closer to the earth; but when Venus has been left 48× behind and has stood still, she descends her own proper sphere and overtakes the Sun. Thereafter, being the more depressed, they again precede him by the same distance, and when they have been elevated on their spheres they have their evening stations. Then they are again overtaken by him and within the 15× their concealments take place. The stars are in concord with their effects . . .;;(Col. XI);[- - -] . . . when they stand still they are powerful in their proper effects. But the three stars rising in opposition to the Sun move, preceding the Sun and removed from him by 15×; they come to a standstill when they are 120× away from him and are powerful in their influences; when they are 180× away and are in opposition to him they make their western evening rising and still retreat; then they turn backward in their course and are unfavorable to their own effects; then for the second time they stand still; and at the first [of their station] their significance is good, but at the end evil. Now they await the Sun, and stand still when the sun is 120× distant from them. Then they are concealed and are divergent from their effects. But Mars besides has two other phases, the ninety-day anomalies, when he is in the sextile aspect to the Sun; and in the first he is strongly maleficent and makes evil those who have their nativities at the time; but in the second [he makes] them daring, bold, evildoers and robbers caught in the act; then coming toward him the Sun is in the sexitle aspect to him.;These are called their configurations and phases. There are four configurations of the Sun, two equinoxes in the eighth degree of Aries and of Libra, and two solstices, the summer, in the eighth degree of Cancer, and the winter in the eighth degree of Capricorn. Of the Moon there are preeminently four configurations: conjunction, when it is unseen(?); first half-moon, when it is seven days old; full moon, when it is fourteen; second half-moon when it is twenty-one. The Moon looses the bonds of longitude and latitude in seven-day periods, but the Sun at the solstitial and equinoctial degrees.;The signs, because of the obliquity of the circle, do not ascend in equal periods, but vary in seven different regions or climes. For in the Ethiopic clime Aries ascends in twenty-two periods and Libra in thirty-eight, in which the amount to be added is 2 2/3; in the Syrian clime Aries ascends in twenty-one and Libra in thirty-nine periods, and the amount to be added or subtracted is 3. In the Rhodian clime [Aries ascends] in twenty and Libra in forty periods, and the amount added or subtracted is 3 1/3; in the clime of Asia and Ionia Aries ascends in nineteen and Libra in forty-one, wherein the amount added or subtracted is 3 2/3; in the clime of Argos;;(Col. XII);Aries ascends in eighteeen [and Libra in forty-two, and the amount] added [is 4]; in the clime of Rome and Italy and maritime Gaul Aries ascends [in seventeen and] Libra in forty-three, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 1/3; in . . ., Germany and [Britain] Aries ascends [in sixteen] and Libra in forty-four, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 2/3. Now in every clime Cancer and Capricornus ascend in thirty periods; fifteen periods equal one equinoctial hour, and the period is of primary importance with reference to life.;For the rest, of the signs of the zodiac some hear one another, some see one another, and some perceive one another. Those that hear one another are the ones beginning with the equinoctial signs which are equally distant from them, and their degrees hear each other's degrees and the signs the signs. For since day does not see night because it is diametrically opposite to it, equal night hears equal day. Whenever night is completed in equal hours with the day, the signs also hear one another in periods of time; for the day in Taurus is thirteen hours, when the Sun passes through Pisces or Taurus. Gemini and Aquarius hear each other; for when the Sun is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and when he is in Aquarius the night is fourteen hours. Cancer and Capricornus also are to one another in the relation of hearing, but they are prevented by the Earth intervening between them. Leo and Sagittarius hear one another, and similarly Virgo and Scorpio, but Libra and Aries do not. Equal day looks upon, but does not hear, equal day; so the ten signs beginning with the tropical signs and equally distant on either side look upon one another; as, for instance, Leo and Gemini; for when the Sun is in Leo and similarly when he is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and the night ten. Similarly Taurus and Virgo look upon one another, then Libra and Aries, then Scorpio and Pisces, then Sagittarius and Aquarius; Capricornus and Cancer, however, have the seeing relation one to another but are thrust apart because of the Earth intervening between them; and no other sign rises where Capricorn rises or where Cancer rises. Thus without seeing each other they rise from these places with no sign looking upon them. For this reason these signs alone cast shadows outside, while the Sun is passing through the signs that look upon one another. Wherefore admittedly day looks upon day. But these signs which perceive one another are the dwelling places of the stars, as Cancer and Leo, Virgo ;;(Col. XIII);[and Gemini, Taurus and Libra, Scorpio and Aries, Pisces and Sagittarius, Capricornus and Aquarius - - -] . . . and the double-bodied, Gemini, Virgo, [Sagittarius, and Pisces . . .] the tropical signs . . . the double-bodied belong to Mercury and Jupiter . . . [- - -] . . . they are called "solid" because of the "solid" signs each one is set aside for a single element . . . [- - -] . . . they are called eccentricities because the earth is the central point of the universe, and is the midmost of the seven planets. Still other ethereal constellations revolve in their own circles. The Sun is in apogee in Gemini; Venus is in perigee in Pisces and in apogee in Virgo; Jupiter is in apogee in Cancer and in perigee in Capricorn . . .;;(Col. XIV-XV: too fragmentary to be translated);;(Col. XVI);[- - -] . . . Hippocrates testified; for he called the Sun Daemon and the Moon Fortune. Leo is a male sign and Cancer female; and to the five gods that move together nature has assigned houses in pairs, a male and a female. For the Sun holds dominion by day, and the Moon by night, and these both by day and by night serve the two kings; and the signs inhabited by them are the vitals of the universe. To Mercury was given the first section, that beneath Leo and Cancer, in which are Virgo and Gemini, female and male. To Venus the zone beneath this, in which are Libra and Taurus, male and female. To Mars the zone beneath this, in which are Scorpio and Aries, female and male. To Jupiter the zone beneath this, in which are Sagittarius and Pisces, male and female. To Saturn the zone over all, Capricornus and Aquarius, female and male. Thus also from these regions they stand guard over the Moon and the Sun. In these signs the stars have their own powers and are vigorous. And nature assigned them thrones and prisons; their thrones the signs upon which they are exalted and have royal power and prisons wherein they are depressed and oppose their own powers. The [throne of the Sun] is at 19× of Aries, [his prison in Libra. The Moon's throne] us 3× of Taurus, [her prison 3× of Scorpio]. Saturn's [throne is 21× of Libra, his prison in Aries. The throne of Jupiter is 15×] of Cancer, his prison 15× [of Capricornus]. The throne of Mars [is 28× of Capricornus and his prison 28] of Cancer. [The throne of] Venus [is 27× of Pisces,] her prison [27× of Virgo].;;(Col. XVII);[- - -] . . . and in Libra, Aquarius and Gemini . . . In Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus the Moon, Venus and Mercury rejoice, and in part Mars, but he does not take part in the governorship because the trianle belongs to similar gods as masters. In Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer Mars and Venus rejoice, and the Moon shares the triangle as well, but does not take part in the governorship by day. This is the order of the houses and exaltations. . . . [Hermes] observed the stars, among the signs of the zodiac, in the degrees from the first of Leo to the thirtieth of Libra increasing, from 1× of Aquarius to 30× of Aries moving . . . in elevation and latitude, and from 1× of Scorpio to 30× of Capricornus and from 1× of Taurus to 30× of Cancer diminishing, and from equal diminishing quadrants he observed the motion of the universal heavenly bodies becoming . . . He observed that the 360× hold significance for the universe; wherefore the universe is itself imperishable . . . For it moves . . . and equal increment and subtraction . . .;;(Col. XVIII);[- - -] . . . they rejoice in the signs before their own exaltations, and affording complete effects . . . perfect; but they are afflicted in the signs following their own exaltations. For the stars depart from their own exaltations and begin to be depressed; they do not rejoice when they are in opposition tro one another unless they exchange houses. The planets of opposite sects are more harmful when in opposition. The maleficent planets are most prone to injure in the quartile aspect and in opposition, but are harmless in trine. The beneficient planets in trine are most beneficial, in the quartile aspect or in opposition less effective. The triangles that come about when the Sun is in trine with respect to the Moon are sure in their effects but the quartile aspect and opposition are not. . . . [- - -] . . . in the quartile aspect or in opposition to the Moon when it is becoming full signifies insecurity, great and bloody dangers; and in quartile aspect to the waning Moon . . . is especially significant of insecurity and danger . . .;;(Col.

"ab","text","(Col. I);;[- - -] . . . Of the fore parts the sphere of the Sun [should be considered] first, for [Saturn and the Sun have] the smallest variation in latitude; it is, then, in size 2 1/2×, that is, 150', for the degree contains 60'; the moon's is 6×, or 360'; that of Saturn 10×, or 600'; that of Jupiter 13× 45'; next, Mercury's sphere is 21× 15' or 1275'; and the sphere of Mars is 42×, or 2520'. The sphere of Venus is the largest, exceeding the breadth of the circle of the zodiac, in which the divinity is exalted and depressed; her sphere, then, is 48× or 2880'. Such is the circuit of their orbits; and by this . . .;;(Col. II) [- - -] . . . they come to apogee and have least apparent motion. Then standing still they begin to turn back . . . to the eye seeming . . . and they seem to move (the faster?) by as much as they are seen to . . ., and with accelerated movement . . . left behind by the Sun on their downward circuit they reach their own spheres. After this they come to perigee and have their greatest apparent motion. Thus the height and the breadth of their epicycles are the cause of the anomaly in their course, for their daily motion is always the same, that of the Sun 59' 8'' 16''', of the Moon 13 whole degrees and 10', of Saturn 2', of Jupiter 5', of Mars 32', and of Venus and Mercury the same as the Sun. These latter two, however, differ from the Sun by reason of their epicycles; for though they have a daily motion that is equal to the Sun's their movement in height and in breadth is not equal to his; but when they get farther south or farther north than the Sun they seem to make retrogressions, or they are passed by the Sun and stand fixed; or they are depressed and run ahead of the Sun. At such times Venus seems to run 5' {5'} <read: 35'>, so as to move more swiftly than the Sun, and Mercury 3× 6', that is, 186'. Since such is their order, [one may] in accordance with the epicycles of each one of them select a portion and by those measures assign it to each, both from the forward parts of the image and from the backward parts. Of the 2880' of Venus, then, one-third is 960' . . .;;(Col. III);[- - -] . . . Next in order, of the 6 1/2× of the Moon, one-third is 2 1/6×, that is, 130'; accordingly at this one hundred thirtieth point the must mark out the Moon's portion. It will extend to the tip of the chin. The visage is the most wonderful part of the image. Thus the whole head is the tabernacle of the Sun and the Moon, but he controls the faculty of knowledge, and she that of change and of affection; and from Mercury comes the faculty of thought, but from the Sum the directive faculty; but the faculty of interpretation is attached to the portion of the Moon, tongue, mouth and speech. For this reason this section is related to each of the sectae and is not far removed from the leader, the Sun. Accordingly, as in man the face is most remarkable for its changes and the affections that occur to it, so the Moon, in the universe, is remarkable for its changes of colors and for its illuminations and emanations. The Moon alone aids the . . . accepting . . . ten times in the course of the year . . . and paying back its waxings and wanings through a period of 28 days . . . And the face is the grace . . . and the Sun . . . the changes most proper to it . . .;;(Col. IV);[- - -] . . . The epicycle of Jupiter measures 13× 45', which is 825', of which one-third is 275'. Accordingly at the two hundred seventy-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Jupiter. It includes the breast as far as the stomach and the liver, in which reside fire, the mental faculty, and the appetitive faculty because the conversion into blood of the food which is introduced into the body is performed by the liver. It is for just this reason that the faculty of command is assigned to this portion; for truly the leader takes forethought for the state as the liver does for the body. If indeed the region of the liver becomes diseased, the whole body immediately becomes jaundiced or dropsical and like a corpse, because the blood is not properly managed. Therefore such things come to mankind from Jupiter, and therefore also the omens are observed in the livers of the victims by those who perform sacrifices, and appetites for food and sexual intercourse come from the liver. For from its entrance a broad vessel reaches to the seminal regions, and thus, of the food, a part is made into blood and distributed to the veins and part is divided off into that vessel and becomes semen. For this reason the testicles are on either side. For the sake of this also . . . applied to Zeus the epither "of many offspring"; and within . . . Next in order the epicycle of Mercury measures 21× 15', or 1275'; one-third of the epicycle is 425'. Accordingly at the four hundred twenty-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Mercury . . .;;(Col. V);[- - -] . . . And next the epicycle of Mars measures 42× or 2520', one-third of which is 840'; so at the eight hundred fortieth point we must mark off the portion of Mars. t will include the hands from the wrists, the pubes, the genital organs, the thighs and knees, and will end at the shins. For this reason the principle of the seed is naturally aroused in the period of Mars, who returns to his original position every 15 years; so at that time boys show signs of manhood, their voices break and they show the outward signs of puberty according to the times which the fates may hold for them; for in some cases they will be found to bring it about in 12 years, in some in 13, in some in 14, in some in 15, and in some in 16 or a little more; for these things come about in consequence of the ascensions of the Sun. From Mars indeed come manhood and the impulse to arms, from about the fifteenth year; for this reason boys are given the Olympic crown even in the twelfth year, in the zodiacal period of Jupiter, but they do not bear arms unless the period of Mars, 15 years, has been fulfilled. Castrations, the cutting off of the genital organs, the changes of women, and abortions come from Mars; and further, both incontinence and virginity are within his province, when he is moved in a certain way - about which things I have spoken in the book on the influences of the stars. Again, the breaking of thighs, the wrenching of knees, and the bruising and wounding of the shins are from Mars.;The last epicycle, which brings to an end the forward parts of the image, is that of Venus, measuring 48× or 2880', and one-third of this is 960'. The portion of Venus is from the shins to the toe nails . . .;;(Col. VI);[- - -] . . . the 840' are also slavish . . . below this we must assign 50' to the Sun as his portion. It will reach to the neck, which portion we assigned to the Sun as leader and master; then are assigned . . . fostered by the Sun somewhat in this manner; for these affections are from above. But at 130' we must mark off the portion of the Moon; and it will include the calves; and somehow, whenever we see a noteworthy face, we go around and straightway see the calf of the leg, since naturally the portion of the Moon which is akin to it leads us all to this. Afflictions, fractures, and amputations of the legs come about through the Moon's influence. Then to 200' is the portion of Saturn, the back of the knees and extremities of the hams of ever wearied men. Then to 275' is the portion of Jupiter; the hams; hence beloved boys and those who are well adapted for the practice are led to these courses through the influence of Jupiter; Ganymede serves to express this in mythology for those whose courses are natural.. And at 425' we must mark off the portion of Mercury; it will include the buttocks to the hip-joints and a little higher. This region also aids the belly and is impure. Accordingly when people have a base disease and suffer unnaturally, if it be against their will and consent, then it will be found that in the genitures of these men Venus is injured in these daemonic degrees of Mercury; but if it is by their own devices the star of Mercury will be found injured in these same degrees. The rest belongs to Mars as far as the middle of the neck; for the neck is divided; at that point the 840' ends. For the whole head belongs to the Sun and the Moon, but of the neck the forward part belongs to Saturn and the back to Mars; for this reason . . . bear on their backs.;;(Col. VII);[- - -] . . . as far as the last degree of Aries increasing . . . if it be found . . . from the first degree of Leo. Count the degrees until you come to the degree of the star and take one-third of the number, and if it is less than 16, the star is in dominant degrees, but if more than what they are up to Capricornus and away from Taurus. So must you do: if the star os fpimd om these quadrants between the first degree and the remainder of the quadrant up to the last degree, you must observe and take one-third of it and similarly observe whether the discovered number is more or less than 16. So that what I say may be easier and readier to understand, thus shall it be known: from 1× of Leo to 18× of Virgo there are fulfilled three times 16, of the fore parts, and from 1× [of Aquarius] to 18× [of Pisces] similarly; and again, from 12× [of Gemini] to 30× of Cancer, and from 12× [of Sagittarius] to 30× of Capricorn. The degrees of the forward parts are 48 altogether. And from 18× of Virgo [to 30× of Libra and from 18× of Pisces to 30× of Aries is 42×; and from 1× of Taurus to 12× of Gemini, as well as from 1×óof Scorpio to 12× of Sagittarius, is 42×]. And they all belong to the external degrees and hinder parts.;And these are likewise the true and natural termini of the seven gods, the peculiar possessions of each several one of them. For example, [from 1× of Leo and Aquarius to 2 1/2× is the terminus of the Sun, and from] 2 1/2× of Leo and Aquarius to 6 1/2× is the terminus of the Moon; from 6 1/2× to 10×, of Saturn; from 10× to 13× 45' of Jupiter; from 13× 45' to 24× 15' of Mercury; from 24× 15' of Leo to 12× of Virgo, and from 24× 15' of Aquarius to 12× [of Pisces], of Mars; and from 12× of Virgo [and of Pisces] to 18× of Virgo and of Pisces belongs to Venus. These are dominant [degrees]. Again, from 12× of Gemini and 12× of Sagittarius to 14 1/2× of Gemini and 14 1/2× of Sagittarius belongs to the Sun; these termini are dominant degrees up to 18× of the two signs; to 22× of the two signs is the property of Saturn . . .;;(Col. VIII);[- - -] . . . and from 18× of Virgo and Pisces to 20 1/2× of both signs is the terminus of the Sun, daemonic; from 20 1/2× of both signs to 24 1/2× is the Moon's terminus; from 241 /2× of both signs to 28× is the terminus of Saturn; [from 28×] of both to 1× 45' of Libra and Aries to [14× 15' of Libra and Aries is the terminus of Mercury; and from 14× 15' of both signs to 30× of Libra and] Aries is the terminus of MArs, daemonic. Again, from 1× of Scorpio and of Taurus to 12× of Sagittarius [and of Gemini] is the terminus of Mars. Thus let these termini be marked out.;There are two sects, of night and day, of the Sun and [of the Moon], and the Sun rules the day and the Moon runs the night. Saturn and Jupiter are the bodyguards of the Sun, Mars and Venus of the Moon; Mercury belongs to the Moon by night and to the Sun by day. Whenever, then, it is needful to test a star so must you test it. In diurnal genitures . . . let the [diurnal] star be found within the 16×, [and the nocturnal] outside of them; and in nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars be found within and the diurnal outside of the 16×; for the reverse is evil. And preferably let the lords of the houses of the luminaries and the masters of the centers and the lords of the loci be found upon the numbers; for greater happiness results; and preferably let the sects be performing their own proper acts; for the exchange of properties between the sects is fatal.;There are seven significant signs, the horoscope, the fourth from it, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. Let, therefore, the stars that form the geniture be ruling their houses in the significant signs, and so let them be found, for this is best. Andf let the diurnal stars be at the diurnal centers not only in terms of signs, but also of degrees, or let them be moving toward the centers, and let the nocturnal stars be retreating. But in the nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars;;(Col. IX);be at the nocturnal centers in terms of signs and degrees . . . their advance is hostile . . . if at night, the Moon. And by day let the Sun abide in a masculine sign, by night, the Moon. By day let Saturn be at the horoscope or zenith, standing in some relation to the geniture; by night similarly Mars; for the reverse is bad, particularly if they are not sympathetic to the geniture.;The centers are called horoscope, zenith, occident, nadir. The second from the horoscope is Hope; the third Friends and Goddess; the fourth Foundation, Base, Resource; the fifth Good Fortune; the sixth Daemonie; the seventh Sign of Death; the eighth Inactive; the Ninth Defection and Region of Strange Land; the tenth Accomplishment; the eleventh Good Daemon; [the twelfth Evil Daemon]. Now according to Asclepius the subjects of the inquiry are thus arranged; from the horoscope questions of length of life are to be sought; from the second in the upward direction, livelihood; from the third, brothers; from the fourth, parents; from the fifth, children; from the sixth, injury or suffering; from the seventh, wife; from the eighth, fortune and death that puts a bound to all, according to the lords of these houses. We, however, seek from the horoscope length of life and peculiarities of soul, from the Sun father, patrimony, leaders, and the senses; from the Moon mother, maternal endowment, and body; from Saturn the confirmation of every written instrument, evil or good, and benefit from inheritances from elders and from the death of outsiders, and crops from the earth; from Jupiter offices, preisthoods, knowledge, children, wealth; from Mars, brothers, and arts of violence carried out by means of fire and iron. Injury comes from Mars, Saturn and the horoscope; by day . . . from Saturn to Mars . . .;;(Col. X);[- - -] . . . [we inquire about] death from the descending sign, and call it the Theme of Death; and in all the book on planetary effects . . . But now we must speak of the phases of the stars or about the Sun's rising and setting . . . And the motion of the planets thus brings about in the case of Mercury and Venus the occasions of their being left behind or running ahead, and in the case of the three remaining planets their stations and retrogressions. Now when the Sun runs 15× away from the stars, the stars rise and exercise especial power upon genitures. Mars is an excessively evil influence at rising until he has escaped from the hostile fire of the Sun. Mercury again overtakes the Sun only after having been left 22× behind him; for as he descends his sphere he comes closer to the earth; but when Venus has been left 48× behind and has stood still, she descends her own proper sphere and overtakes the Sun. Thereafter, being the more depressed, they again precede him by the same distance, and when they have been elevated on their spheres they have their evening stations. Then they are again overtaken by him and within the 15× their concealments take place. The stars are in concord with their effects . . .;;(Col. XI);[- - -] . . . when they stand still they are powerful in their proper effects. But the three stars rising in opposition to the Sun move, preceding the Sun and removed from him by 15×; they come to a standstill when they are 120× away from him and are powerful in their influences; when they are 180× away and are in opposition to him they make their western evening rising and still retreat; then they turn backward in their course and are unfavorable to their own effects; then for the second time they stand still; and at the first [of their station] their significance is good, but at the end evil. Now they await the Sun, and stand still when the sun is 120× distant from them. Then they are concealed and are divergent from their effects. But Mars besides has two other phases, the ninety-day anomalies, when he is in the sextile aspect to the Sun; and in the first he is strongly maleficent and makes evil those who have their nativities at the time; but in the second [he makes] them daring, bold, evildoers and robbers caught in the act; then coming toward him the Sun is in the sexitle aspect to him.;These are called their configurations and phases. There are four configurations of the Sun, two equinoxes in the eighth degree of Aries and of Libra, and two solstices, the summer, in the eighth degree of Cancer, and the winter in the eighth degree of Capricorn. Of the Moon there are preeminently four configurations: conjunction, when it is unseen(?); first half-moon, when it is seven days old; full moon, when it is fourteen; second half-moon when it is twenty-one. The Moon looses the bonds of longitude and latitude in seven-day periods, but the Sun at the solstitial and equinoctial degrees.;The signs, because of the obliquity of the circle, do not ascend in equal periods, but vary in seven different regions or climes. For in the Ethiopic clime Aries ascends in twenty-two periods and Libra in thirty-eight, in which the amount to be added is 2 2/3; in the Syrian clime Aries ascends in twenty-one and Libra in thirty-nine periods, and the amount to be added or subtracted is 3. In the Rhodian clime [Aries ascends] in twenty and Libra in forty periods, and the amount added or subtracted is 3 1/3; in the clime of Asia and Ionia Aries ascends in nineteen and Libra in forty-one, wherein the amount added or subtracted is 3 2/3; in the clime of Argos;;(Col. XII);Aries ascends in eighteeen [and Libra in forty-two, and the amount] added [is 4]; in the clime of Rome and Italy and maritime Gaul Aries ascends [in seventeen and] Libra in forty-three, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 1/3; in . . ., Germany and [Britain] Aries ascends [in sixteen] and Libra in forty-four, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 2/3. Now in every clime Cancer and Capricornus ascend in thirty periods; fifteen periods equal one equinoctial hour, and the period is of primary importance with reference to life.;For the rest, of the signs of the zodiac some hear one another, some see one another, and some perceive one another. Those that hear one another are the ones beginning with the equinoctial signs which are equally distant from them, and their degrees hear each other's degrees and the signs the signs. For since day does not see night because it is diametrically opposite to it, equal night hears equal day. Whenever night is completed in equal hours with the day, the signs also hear one another in periods of time; for the day in Taurus is thirteen hours, when the Sun passes through Pisces or Taurus. Gemini and Aquarius hear each other; for when the Sun is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and when he is in Aquarius the night is fourteen hours. Cancer and Capricornus also are to one another in the relation of hearing, but they are prevented by the Earth intervening between them. Leo and Sagittarius hear one another, and similarly Virgo and Scorpio, but Libra and Aries do not. Equal day looks upon, but does not hear, equal day; so the ten signs beginning with the tropical signs and equally distant on either side look upon one another; as, for instance, Leo and Gemini; for when the Sun is in Leo and similarly when he is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and the night ten. Similarly Taurus and Virgo look upon one another, then Libra and Aries, then Scorpio and Pisces, then Sagittarius and Aquarius; Capricornus and Cancer, however, have the seeing relation one to another but are thrust apart because of the Earth intervening between them; and no other sign rises where Capricorn rises or where Cancer rises. Thus without seeing each other they rise from these places with no sign looking upon them. For this reason these signs alone cast shadows outside, while the Sun is passing through the signs that look upon one another. Wherefore admittedly day looks upon day. But these signs which perceive one another are the dwelling places of the stars, as Cancer and Leo, Virgo ;;(Col. XIII);[and Gemini, Taurus and Libra, Scorpio and Aries, Pisces and Sagittarius, Capricornus and Aquarius - - -] . . . and the double-bodied, Gemini, Virgo, [Sagittarius, and Pisces . . .] the tropical signs . . . the double-bodied belong to Mercury and Jupiter . . . [- - -] . . . they are called "solid" because of the "solid" signs each one is set aside for a single element . . . [- - -] . . . they are called eccentricities because the earth is the central point of the universe, and is the midmost of the seven planets. Still other ethereal constellations revolve in their own circles. The Sun is in apogee in Gemini; Venus is in perigee in Pisces and in apogee in Virgo; Jupiter is in apogee in Cancer and in perigee in Capricorn . . .;;(Col. XIV-XV: too fragmentary to be translated);;(Col. XVI);[- - -] . . . Hippocrates testified; for he called the Sun Daemon and the Moon Fortune. Leo is a male sign and Cancer female; and to the five gods that move together nature has assigned houses in pairs, a male and a female. For the Sun holds dominion by day, and the Moon by night, and these both by day and by night serve the two kings; and the signs inhabited by them are the vitals of the universe. To Mercury was given the first section, that beneath Leo and Cancer, in which are Virgo and Gemini, female and male. To Venus the zone beneath this, in which are Libra and Taurus, male and female. To Mars the zone beneath this, in which are Scorpio and Aries, female and male. To Jupiter the zone beneath this, in which are Sagittarius and Pisces, male and female. To Saturn the zone over all, Capricornus and Aquarius, female and male. Thus also from these regions they stand guard over the Moon and the Sun. In these signs the stars have their own powers and are vigorous. And nature assigned them thrones and prisons; their thrones the signs upon which they are exalted and have royal power and prisons wherein they are depressed and oppose their own powers. The [throne of the Sun] is at 19× of Aries, [his prison in Libra. The Moon's throne] us 3× of Taurus, [her prison 3× of Scorpio]. Saturn's [throne is 21× of Libra, his prison in Aries. The throne of Jupiter is 15×] of Cancer, his prison 15× [of Capricornus]. The throne of Mars [is 28× of Capricornus and his prison 28] of Cancer. [The throne of] Venus [is 27× of Pisces,] her prison [27× of Virgo].;;(Col. XVII);[- - -] . . . and in Libra, Aquarius and Gemini . . . In Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus the Moon, Venus and Mercury rejoice, and in part Mars, but he does not take part in the governorship because the trianle belongs to similar gods as masters. In Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer Mars and Venus rejoice, and the Moon shares the triangle as well, but does not take part in the governorship by day. This is the order of the houses and exaltations. . . . [Hermes] observed the stars, among the signs of the zodiac, in the degrees from the first of Leo to the thirtieth of Libra increasing, from 1× of Aquarius to 30× of Aries moving . . . in elevation and latitude, and from 1× of Scorpio to 30× of Capricornus and from 1× of Taurus to 30× of Cancer diminishing, and from equal diminishing quadrants he observed the motion of the universal heavenly bodies becoming . . . He observed that the 360× hold significance for the universe; wherefore the universe is itself imperishable . . . For it moves . . . and equal increment and subtraction . . .;;(Col. XVIII);[- - -] . . . they rejoice in the signs before their own exaltations, and affording complete effects . . . perfect; but they are afflicted in the signs following their own exaltations. For the stars depart from their own exaltations and begin to be depressed; they do not rejoice when they are in opposition tro one another unless they exchange houses. The planets of opposite sects are more harmful when in opposition. The maleficent planets are most prone to injure in the quartile aspect and in opposition, but are harmless in trine. The beneficient planets in trine are most beneficial, in the quartile aspect or in opposition less effective. The triangles that come about when the Sun is in trine with respect to the Moon are sure in their effects but the quartile aspect and opposition are not. . . . [- - -] . . . in the quartile aspect or in opposition to the Moon when it is becoming full signifies insecurity, great and bloody dangers; and in quartile aspect to the waning Moon . . . is especially significant of insecurity and danger . . .;;(Col.

Of the fore parts the sphere of the Sun [should be considered] first, for [Saturn and the Sun have] the smallest variation in latitude; it is, then, in size 2 1/2×, that is, 150', for the degree contains 60'; the moon's is 6×, or 360'; that of Saturn 10×, or 600'; that of Jupiter 13× 45'; next, Mercury's sphere is 21× 15' or 1275'; and the sphere of Mars is 42×, or 2520'. The sphere of Venus is the largest, exceeding the breadth of the circle of the zodiac, in which the divinity is exalted and depressed; her sphere, then, is 48× or 2880'. Such is the circuit of their orbits; and by this . . .;;(Col. II) [- - -] . . . they come to apogee and have least apparent motion. Then standing still they begin to turn back . . . to the eye seeming . . . and they seem to move (the faster?) by as much as they are seen to . . ., and with accelerated movement . . . left behind by the Sun on their downward circuit they reach their own spheres. After this they come to perigee and have their greatest apparent motion. Thus the height and the breadth of their epicycles are the cause of the anomaly in their course, for their daily motion is always the same, that of the Sun 59' 8'' 16''', of the Moon 13 whole degrees and 10', of Saturn 2', of Jupiter 5', of Mars 32', and of Venus and Mercury the same as the Sun. These latter two, however, differ from the Sun by reason of their epicycles; for though they have a daily motion that is equal to the Sun's their movement in height and in breadth is not equal to his; but when they get farther south or farther north than the Sun they seem to make retrogressions, or they are passed by the Sun and stand fixed; or they are depressed and run ahead of the Sun. At such times Venus seems to run 5' {5'} <read: 35'>, so as to move more swiftly than the Sun, and Mercury 3× 6', that is, 186'. Since such is their order, [one may] in accordance with the epicycles of each one of them select a portion and by those measures assign it to each, both from the forward parts of the image and from the backward parts. Of the 2880' of Venus, then, one-third is 960' . . .;;(Col. III);[- - -] . . . Next in order, of the 6 1/2× of the Moon, one-third is 2 1/6×, that is, 130'; accordingly at this one hundred thirtieth point the must mark out the Moon's portion. It will extend to the tip of the chin. The visage is the most wonderful part of the image. Thus the whole head is the tabernacle of the Sun and the Moon, but he controls the faculty of knowledge, and she that of change and of affection; and from Mercury comes the faculty of thought, but from the Sum the directive faculty; but the faculty of interpretation is attached to the portion of the Moon, tongue, mouth and speech. For this reason this section is related to each of the sectae and is not far removed from the leader, the Sun. Accordingly, as in man the face is most remarkable for its changes and the affections that occur to it, so the Moon, in the universe, is remarkable for its changes of colors and for its illuminations and emanations. The Moon alone aids the . . . accepting . . . ten times in the course of the year . . . and paying back its waxings and wanings through a period of 28 days . . . And the face is the grace . . . and the Sun . . . the changes most proper to it . . .;;(Col. IV);[- - -] . . . The epicycle of Jupiter measures 13× 45', which is 825', of which one-third is 275'. Accordingly at the two hundred seventy-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Jupiter. It includes the breast as far as the stomach and the liver, in which reside fire, the mental faculty, and the appetitive faculty because the conversion into blood of the food which is introduced into the body is performed by the liver. It is for just this reason that the faculty of command is assigned to this portion; for truly the leader takes forethought for the state as the liver does for the body. If indeed the region of the liver becomes diseased, the whole body immediately becomes jaundiced or dropsical and like a corpse, because the blood is not properly managed. Therefore such things come to mankind from Jupiter, and therefore also the omens are observed in the livers of the victims by those who perform sacrifices, and appetites for food and sexual intercourse come from the liver. For from its entrance a broad vessel reaches to the seminal regions, and thus, of the food, a part is made into blood and distributed to the veins and part is divided off into that vessel and becomes semen. For this reason the testicles are on either side. For the sake of this also . . . applied to Zeus the epither "of many offspring"; and within . . . Next in order the epicycle of Mercury measures 21× 15', or 1275'; one-third of the epicycle is 425'. Accordingly at the four hundred twenty-fifth point we must mark off the portion of Mercury . . .;;(Col. V);[- - -] . . . And next the epicycle of Mars measures 42× or 2520', one-third of which is 840'; so at the eight hundred fortieth point we must mark off the portion of Mars. t will include the hands from the wrists, the pubes, the genital organs, the thighs and knees, and will end at the shins. For this reason the principle of the seed is naturally aroused in the period of Mars, who returns to his original position every 15 years; so at that time boys show signs of manhood, their voices break and they show the outward signs of puberty according to the times which the fates may hold for them; for in some cases they will be found to bring it about in 12 years, in some in 13, in some in 14, in some in 15, and in some in 16 or a little more; for these things come about in consequence of the ascensions of the Sun. From Mars indeed come manhood and the impulse to arms, from about the fifteenth year; for this reason boys are given the Olympic crown even in the twelfth year, in the zodiacal period of Jupiter, but they do not bear arms unless the period of Mars, 15 years, has been fulfilled. Castrations, the cutting off of the genital organs, the changes of women, and abortions come from Mars; and further, both incontinence and virginity are within his province, when he is moved in a certain way - about which things I have spoken in the book on the influences of the stars. Again, the breaking of thighs, the wrenching of knees, and the bruising and wounding of the shins are from Mars.;The last epicycle, which brings to an end the forward parts of the image, is that of Venus, measuring 48× or 2880', and one-third of this is 960'. The portion of Venus is from the shins to the toe nails . . .;;(Col. VI);[- - -] . . . the 840' are also slavish . . . below this we must assign 50' to the Sun as his portion. It will reach to the neck, which portion we assigned to the Sun as leader and master; then are assigned . . . fostered by the Sun somewhat in this manner; for these affections are from above. But at 130' we must mark off the portion of the Moon; and it will include the calves; and somehow, whenever we see a noteworthy face, we go around and straightway see the calf of the leg, since naturally the portion of the Moon which is akin to it leads us all to this. Afflictions, fractures, and amputations of the legs come about through the Moon's influence. Then to 200' is the portion of Saturn, the back of the knees and extremities of the hams of ever wearied men. Then to 275' is the portion of Jupiter; the hams; hence beloved boys and those who are well adapted for the practice are led to these courses through the influence of Jupiter; Ganymede serves to express this in mythology for those whose courses are natural.. And at 425' we must mark off the portion of Mercury; it will include the buttocks to the hip-joints and a little higher. This region also aids the belly and is impure. Accordingly when people have a base disease and suffer unnaturally, if it be against their will and consent, then it will be found that in the genitures of these men Venus is injured in these daemonic degrees of Mercury; but if it is by their own devices the star of Mercury will be found injured in these same degrees. The rest belongs to Mars as far as the middle of the neck; for the neck is divided; at that point the 840' ends. For the whole head belongs to the Sun and the Moon, but of the neck the forward part belongs to Saturn and the back to Mars; for this reason . . . bear on their backs.;;(Col. VII);[- - -] . . . as far as the last degree of Aries increasing . . . if it be found . . . from the first degree of Leo. Count the degrees until you come to the degree of the star and take one-third of the number, and if it is less than 16, the star is in dominant degrees, but if more than what they are up to Capricornus and away from Taurus. So must you do: if the star os fpimd om these quadrants between the first degree and the remainder of the quadrant up to the last degree, you must observe and take one-third of it and similarly observe whether the discovered number is more or less than 16. So that what I say may be easier and readier to understand, thus shall it be known: from 1× of Leo to 18× of Virgo there are fulfilled three times 16, of the fore parts, and from 1× [of Aquarius] to 18× [of Pisces] similarly; and again, from 12× [of Gemini] to 30× of Cancer, and from 12× [of Sagittarius] to 30× of Capricorn. The degrees of the forward parts are 48 altogether. And from 18× of Virgo [to 30× of Libra and from 18× of Pisces to 30× of Aries is 42×; and from 1× of Taurus to 12× of Gemini, as well as from 1×óof Scorpio to 12× of Sagittarius, is 42×]. And they all belong to the external degrees and hinder parts.;And these are likewise the true and natural termini of the seven gods, the peculiar possessions of each several one of them. For example, [from 1× of Leo and Aquarius to 2 1/2× is the terminus of the Sun, and from] 2 1/2× of Leo and Aquarius to 6 1/2× is the terminus of the Moon; from 6 1/2× to 10×, of Saturn; from 10× to 13× 45' of Jupiter; from 13× 45' to 24× 15' of Mercury; from 24× 15' of Leo to 12× of Virgo, and from 24× 15' of Aquarius to 12× [of Pisces], of Mars; and from 12× of Virgo [and of Pisces] to 18× of Virgo and of Pisces belongs to Venus. These are dominant [degrees]. Again, from 12× of Gemini and 12× of Sagittarius to 14 1/2× of Gemini and 14 1/2× of Sagittarius belongs to the Sun; these termini are dominant degrees up to 18× of the two signs; to 22× of the two signs is the property of Saturn . . .;;(Col. VIII);[- - -] . . . and from 18× of Virgo and Pisces to 20 1/2× of both signs is the terminus of the Sun, daemonic; from 20 1/2× of both signs to 24 1/2× is the Moon's terminus; from 241 /2× of both signs to 28× is the terminus of Saturn; [from 28×] of both to 1× 45' of Libra and Aries to [14× 15' of Libra and Aries is the terminus of Mercury; and from 14× 15' of both signs to 30× of Libra and] Aries is the terminus of MArs, daemonic. Again, from 1× of Scorpio and of Taurus to 12× of Sagittarius [and of Gemini] is the terminus of Mars. Thus let these termini be marked out.;There are two sects, of night and day, of the Sun and [of the Moon], and the Sun rules the day and the Moon runs the night. Saturn and Jupiter are the bodyguards of the Sun, Mars and Venus of the Moon; Mercury belongs to the Moon by night and to the Sun by day. Whenever, then, it is needful to test a star so must you test it. In diurnal genitures . . . let the [diurnal] star be found within the 16×, [and the nocturnal] outside of them; and in nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars be found within and the diurnal outside of the 16×; for the reverse is evil. And preferably let the lords of the houses of the luminaries and the masters of the centers and the lords of the loci be found upon the numbers; for greater happiness results; and preferably let the sects be performing their own proper acts; for the exchange of properties between the sects is fatal.;There are seven significant signs, the horoscope, the fourth from it, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. Let, therefore, the stars that form the geniture be ruling their houses in the significant signs, and so let them be found, for this is best. Andf let the diurnal stars be at the diurnal centers not only in terms of signs, but also of degrees, or let them be moving toward the centers, and let the nocturnal stars be retreating. But in the nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars;;(Col. IX);be at the nocturnal centers in terms of signs and degrees . . . their advance is hostile . . . if at night, the Moon. And by day let the Sun abide in a masculine sign, by night, the Moon. By day let Saturn be at the horoscope or zenith, standing in some relation to the geniture; by night similarly Mars; for the reverse is bad, particularly if they are not sympathetic to the geniture.;The centers are called horoscope, zenith, occident, nadir. The second from the horoscope is Hope; the third Friends and Goddess; the fourth Foundation, Base, Resource; the fifth Good Fortune; the sixth Daemonie; the seventh Sign of Death; the eighth Inactive; the Ninth Defection and Region of Strange Land; the tenth Accomplishment; the eleventh Good Daemon; [the twelfth Evil Daemon]. Now according to Asclepius the subjects of the inquiry are thus arranged; from the horoscope questions of length of life are to be sought; from the second in the upward direction, livelihood; from the third, brothers; from the fourth, parents; from the fifth, children; from the sixth, injury or suffering; from the seventh, wife; from the eighth, fortune and death that puts a bound to all, according to the lords of these houses. We, however, seek from the horoscope length of life and peculiarities of soul, from the Sun father, patrimony, leaders, and the senses; from the Moon mother, maternal endowment, and body; from Saturn the confirmation of every written instrument, evil or good, and benefit from inheritances from elders and from the death of outsiders, and crops from the earth; from Jupiter offices, preisthoods, knowledge, children, wealth; from Mars, brothers, and arts of violence carried out by means of fire and iron. Injury comes from Mars, Saturn and the horoscope; by day . . . from Saturn to Mars . . .;;(Col. X);[- - -] . . . [we inquire about] death from the descending sign, and call it the Theme of Death; and in all the book on planetary effects . . . But now we must speak of the phases of the stars or about the Sun's rising and setting . . . And the motion of the planets thus brings about in the case of Mercury and Venus the occasions of their being left behind or running ahead, and in the case of the three remaining planets their stations and retrogressions. Now when the Sun runs 15× away from the stars, the stars rise and exercise especial power upon genitures. Mars is an excessively evil influence at rising until he has escaped from the hostile fire of the Sun. Mercury again overtakes the Sun only after having been left 22× behind him; for as he descends his sphere he comes closer to the earth; but when Venus has been left 48× behind and has stood still, she descends her own proper sphere and overtakes the Sun. Thereafter, being the more depressed, they again precede him by the same distance, and when they have been elevated on their spheres they have their evening stations. Then they are again overtaken by him and within the 15× their concealments take place. The stars are in concord with their effects . . .;;(Col. XI);[- - -] . . . when they stand still they are powerful in their proper effects. But the three stars rising in opposition to the Sun move, preceding the Sun and removed from him by 15×; they come to a standstill when they are 120× away from him and are powerful in their influences; when they are 180× away and are in opposition to him they make their western evening rising and still retreat; then they turn backward in their course and are unfavorable to their own effects; then for the second time they stand still; and at the first [of their station] their significance is good, but at the end evil. Now they await the Sun, and stand still when the sun is 120× distant from them. Then they are concealed and are divergent from their effects. But Mars besides has two other phases, the ninety-day anomalies, when he is in the sextile aspect to the Sun; and in the first he is strongly maleficent and makes evil those who have their nativities at the time; but in the second [he makes] them daring, bold, evildoers and robbers caught in the act; then coming toward him the Sun is in the sexitle aspect to him.;These are called their configurations and phases. There are four configurations of the Sun, two equinoxes in the eighth degree of Aries and of Libra, and two solstices, the summer, in the eighth degree of Cancer, and the winter in the eighth degree of Capricorn. Of the Moon there are preeminently four configurations: conjunction, when it is unseen(?); first half-moon, when it is seven days old; full moon, when it is fourteen; second half-moon when it is twenty-one. The Moon looses the bonds of longitude and latitude in seven-day periods, but the Sun at the solstitial and equinoctial degrees.;The signs, because of the obliquity of the circle, do not ascend in equal periods, but vary in seven different regions or climes. For in the Ethiopic clime Aries ascends in twenty-two periods and Libra in thirty-eight, in which the amount to be added is 2 2/3; in the Syrian clime Aries ascends in twenty-one and Libra in thirty-nine periods, and the amount to be added or subtracted is 3. In the Rhodian clime [Aries ascends] in twenty and Libra in forty periods, and the amount added or subtracted is 3 1/3; in the clime of Asia and Ionia Aries ascends in nineteen and Libra in forty-one, wherein the amount added or subtracted is 3 2/3; in the clime of Argos;;(Col. XII);Aries ascends in eighteeen [and Libra in forty-two, and the amount] added [is 4]; in the clime of Rome and Italy and maritime Gaul Aries ascends [in seventeen and] Libra in forty-three, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 1/3; in . . ., Germany and [Britain] Aries ascends [in sixteen] and Libra in forty-four, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 2/3. Now in every clime Cancer and Capricornus ascend in thirty periods; fifteen periods equal one equinoctial hour, and the period is of primary importance with reference to life.;For the rest, of the signs of the zodiac some hear one another, some see one another, and some perceive one another. Those that hear one another are the ones beginning with the equinoctial signs which are equally distant from them, and their degrees hear each other's degrees and the signs the signs. For since day does not see night because it is diametrically opposite to it, equal night hears equal day. Whenever night is completed in equal hours with the day, the signs also hear one another in periods of time; for the day in Taurus is thirteen hours, when the Sun passes through Pisces or Taurus. Gemini and Aquarius hear each other; for when the Sun is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and when he is in Aquarius the night is fourteen hours. Cancer and Capricornus also are to one another in the relation of hearing, but they are prevented by the Earth intervening between them. Leo and Sagittarius hear one another, and similarly Virgo and Scorpio, but Libra and Aries do not. Equal day looks upon, but does not hear, equal day; so the ten signs beginning with the tropical signs and equally distant on either side look upon one another; as, for instance, Leo and Gemini; for when the Sun is in Leo and similarly when he is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and the night ten. Similarly Taurus and Virgo look upon one another, then Libra and Aries, then Scorpio and Pisces, then Sagittarius and Aquarius; Capricornus and Cancer, however, have the seeing relation one to another but are thrust apart because of the Earth intervening between them; and no other sign rises where Capricorn rises or where Cancer rises. Thus without seeing each other they rise from these places with no sign looking upon them. For this reason these signs alone cast shadows outside, while the Sun is passing through the signs that look upon one another. Wherefore admittedly day looks upon day. But these signs which perceive one another are the dwelling places of the stars, as Cancer and Leo, Virgo ;;(Col. XIII);[and Gemini, Taurus and Libra, Scorpio and Aries, Pisces and Sagittarius, Capricornus and Aquarius - - -] . . . and the double-bodied, Gemini, Virgo, [Sagittarius, and Pisces . . .] the tropical signs . . . the double-bodied belong to Mercury and Jupiter . . . [- - -] . . . they are called "solid" because of the "solid" signs each one is set aside for a single element . . . [- - -] . . . they are called eccentricities because the earth is the central point of the universe, and is the midmost of the seven planets. Still other ethereal constellations revolve in their own circles. The Sun is in apogee in Gemini; Venus is in perigee in Pisces and in apogee in Virgo; Jupiter is in apogee in Cancer and in perigee in Capricorn . . .;;(Col. XIV-XV: too fragmentary to be translated);;(Col. XVI);[- - -] . . . Hippocrates testified; for he called the Sun Daemon and the Moon Fortune. Leo is a male sign and Cancer female; and to the five gods that move together nature has assigned houses in pairs, a male and a female. For the Sun holds dominion by day, and the Moon by night, and these both by day and by night serve the two kings; and the signs inhabited by them are the vitals of the universe. To Mercury was given the first section, that beneath Leo and Cancer, in which are Virgo and Gemini, female and male. To Venus the zone beneath this, in which are Libra and Taurus, male and female. To Mars the zone beneath this, in which are Scorpio and Aries, female and male. To Jupiter the zone beneath this, in which are Sagittarius and Pisces, male and female. To Saturn the zone over all, Capricornus and Aquarius, female and male. Thus also from these regions they stand guard over the Moon and the Sun. In these signs the stars have their own powers and are vigorous. And nature assigned them thrones and prisons; their thrones the signs upon which they are exalted and have royal power and prisons wherein they are depressed and oppose their own powers. The [throne of the Sun] is at 19× of Aries, [his prison in Libra. The Moon's throne] us 3× of Taurus, [her prison 3× of Scorpio]. Saturn's [throne is 21× of Libra, his prison in Aries. The throne of Jupiter is 15×] of Cancer, his prison 15× [of Capricornus]. The throne of Mars [is 28× of Capricornus and his prison 28] of Cancer. [The throne of] Venus [is 27× of Pisces,] her prison [27× of Virgo].;;(Col. XVII);[- - -] . . . and in Libra, Aquarius and Gemini . . . In Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus the Moon, Venus and Mercury rejoice, and in part Mars, but he does not take part in the governorship because the trianle belongs to similar gods as masters. In Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer Mars and Venus rejoice, and the Moon shares the triangle as well, but does not take part in the governorship by day. This is the order of the houses and exaltations. . . . [Hermes] observed the stars, among the signs of the zodiac, in the degrees from the first of Leo to the thirtieth of Libra increasing, from 1× of Aquarius to 30× of Aries moving . . . in elevation and latitude, and from 1× of Scorpio to 30× of Capricornus and from 1× of Taurus to 30× of Cancer diminishing, and from equal diminishing quadrants he observed the motion of the universal heavenly bodies becoming . . . He observed that the 360× hold significance for the universe; wherefore the universe is itself imperishable . . . For it moves . . . and equal increment and subtraction . . .;;(Col. XVIII);[- - -] . . . they rejoice in the signs before their own exaltations, and affording complete effects . . . perfect; but they are afflicted in the signs following their own exaltations. For the stars depart from their own exaltations and begin to be depressed; they do not rejoice when they are in opposition tro one another unless they exchange houses. The planets of opposite sects are more harmful when in opposition. The maleficent planets are most prone to injure in the quartile aspect and in opposition, but are harmless in trine. The beneficient planets in trine are most beneficial, in the quartile aspect or in opposition less effective. The triangles that come about when the Sun is in trine with respect to the Moon are sure in their effects but the quartile aspect and opposition are not. . . . [- - -] . . . in the quartile aspect or in opposition to the Moon when it is becoming full signifies insecurity, great and bloody dangers; and in quartile aspect to the waning Moon . . . is especially significant of insecurity and danger . . .;;(Col.

Of the fore parts the sphere of the Sun [should be considered] first, for [Saturn and the Sun have] the smallest variation in latitude; it is, then, in size 2 1/2×, that is, 150', for the degree contains 60'; the moon's is 6×, or 360'; that of Saturn 10×, or 600'; that of Jupiter 13× 45'; next, Mercury's sphere is 21× 15' or 1275'; and the sphere of Mars is 42×, or 2520'.

These latter two, however, differ from the Sun by reason of their epicycles; for though they have a daily motion that is equal to the Sun's their movement in height and in breadth is not equal to his; but when they get farther south or farther north than the Sun they seem to make retrogressions, or they are passed by the Sun and stand fixed; or they are depressed and run ahead of the Sun. At such times Venus seems to run 5' {5'} <read: 35'>, so as to move more swiftly than the Sun, and Mercury 3× 6', that is, 186'. Since such is their order, [one may] in accordance with the epicycles of each one of them select a portion and by those measures assign it to each, both from the forward parts of the image and from the backward parts.

From Mars indeed come manhood and the impulse to arms, from about the fifteenth year; for this reason boys are given the Olympic crown even in the twelfth year, in the zodiacal period of Jupiter, but they do not bear arms unless the period of Mars, 15 years, has been fulfilled. Castrations, the cutting off of the genital organs, the changes of women, and abortions come from Mars; and further, both incontinence and virginity are within his province, when he is moved in a certain way - about which things I have spoken in the book on the influences of the stars.

It will reach to the neck, which portion we assigned to the Sun as leader and master; then are assigned . . . fostered by the Sun somewhat in this manner; for these affections are from above. But at 130' we must mark off the portion of the Moon; and it will include the calves; and somehow, whenever we see a noteworthy face, we go around and straightway see the calf of the leg, since naturally the portion of the Moon which is akin to it leads us all to this. Afflictions, fractures, and amputations of the legs come about through the Moon's influence. Then to 200' is the portion of Saturn, the back of the knees and extremities of the hams of ever wearied men. Then to 275' is the portion of Jupiter; the hams; hence beloved boys and those who are well adapted for the practice are led to these courses through the influence of Jupiter; Ganymede serves to express this in mythology for those whose courses are natural.. And at 425' we must mark off the portion of Mercury; it will include the buttocks to the hip-joints and a little higher. This region also aids the belly and is impure. Accordingly when people have a base disease and suffer unnaturally, if it be against their will and consent, then it will be found that in the genitures of these men Venus is injured in these daemonic degrees of Mercury; but if it is by their own devices the star of Mercury will be found injured in these same degrees. The rest belongs to Mars as far as the middle of the neck; for the neck is divided; at that point the 840' ends. For the whole head belongs to the Sun and the Moon, but of the neck the forward part belongs to Saturn and the back to Mars; for this reason . . . bear on their backs.;;(Col. VII);[- - -] . . . as far as the last degree of Aries increasing . . . if it be found . . . from the first degree of Leo. Count the degrees until you come to the degree of the star and take one-third of the number, and if it is less than 16, the star is in dominant degrees, but if more than what they are up to Capricornus and away from Taurus. So must you do: if the star os fpimd om these quadrants between the first degree and the remainder of the quadrant up to the last degree, you must observe and take one-third of it and similarly observe whether the discovered number is more or less than 16. So that what I say may be easier and readier to understand, thus shall it be known: from 1× of Leo to 18× of Virgo there are fulfilled three times 16, of the fore parts, and from 1× [of Aquarius] to 18× [of Pisces] similarly; and again, from 12× [of Gemini] to 30× of Cancer, and from 12× [of Sagittarius] to 30× of Capricorn. The degrees of the forward parts are 48 altogether. And from 18× of Virgo [to 30× of Libra and from 18× of Pisces to 30× of Aries is 42×; and from 1× of Taurus to 12× of Gemini, as well as from 1×óof Scorpio to 12× of Sagittarius, is 42×]. And they all belong to the external degrees and hinder parts.;And these are likewise the true and natural termini of the seven gods, the peculiar possessions of each several one of them. For example, [from 1× of Leo and Aquarius to 2 1/2× is the terminus of the Sun, and from] 2 1/2× of Leo and Aquarius to 6 1/2× is the terminus of the Moon; from 6 1/2× to 10×, of Saturn; from 10× to 13× 45' of Jupiter; from 13× 45' to 24× 15' of Mercury; from 24× 15' of Leo to 12× of Virgo, and from 24× 15' of Aquarius to 12× [of Pisces], of Mars; and from 12× of Virgo [and of Pisces] to 18× of Virgo and of Pisces belongs to Venus. These are dominant [degrees]. Again, from 12× of Gemini and 12× of Sagittarius to 14 1/2× of Gemini and 14 1/2× of Sagittarius belongs to the Sun; these termini are dominant degrees up to 18× of the two signs; to 22× of the two signs is the property of Saturn . . .;;(Col. VIII);[- - -] . . . and from 18× of Virgo and Pisces to 20 1/2× of both signs is the terminus of the Sun, daemonic; from 20 1/2× of both signs to 24 1/2× is the Moon's terminus; from 241 /2× of both signs to 28× is the terminus of Saturn; [from 28×] of both to 1× 45' of Libra and Aries to [14× 15' of Libra and Aries is the terminus of Mercury; and from 14× 15' of both signs to 30× of Libra and] Aries is the terminus of MArs, daemonic. Again, from 1× of Scorpio and of Taurus to 12× of Sagittarius [and of Gemini] is the terminus of Mars. Thus let these termini be marked out.;There are two sects, of night and day, of the Sun and [of the Moon], and the Sun rules the day and the Moon runs the night. Saturn and Jupiter are the bodyguards of the Sun, Mars and Venus of the Moon; Mercury belongs to the Moon by night and to the Sun by day. Whenever, then, it is needful to test a star so must you test it. In diurnal genitures . . . let the [diurnal] star be found within the 16×, [and the nocturnal] outside of them; and in nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars be found within and the diurnal outside of the 16×; for the reverse is evil. And preferably let the lords of the houses of the luminaries and the masters of the centers and the lords of the loci be found upon the numbers; for greater happiness results; and preferably let the sects be performing their own proper acts; for the exchange of properties between the sects is fatal.;There are seven significant signs, the horoscope, the fourth from it, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. Let, therefore, the stars that form the geniture be ruling their houses in the significant signs, and so let them be found, for this is best. Andf let the diurnal stars be at the diurnal centers not only in terms of signs, but also of degrees, or let them be moving toward the centers, and let the nocturnal stars be retreating. But in the nocturnal genitures, let the nocturnal stars;;(Col. IX);be at the nocturnal centers in terms of signs and degrees . . . their advance is hostile . . . if at night, the Moon. And by day let the Sun abide in a masculine sign, by night, the Moon. By day let Saturn be at the horoscope or zenith, standing in some relation to the geniture; by night similarly Mars; for the reverse is bad, particularly if they are not sympathetic to the geniture.;The centers are called horoscope, zenith, occident, nadir. The second from the horoscope is Hope; the third Friends and Goddess; the fourth Foundation, Base, Resource; the fifth Good Fortune; the sixth Daemonie; the seventh Sign of Death; the eighth Inactive; the Ninth Defection and Region of Strange Land; the tenth Accomplishment; the eleventh Good Daemon; [the twelfth Evil Daemon]. Now according to Asclepius the subjects of the inquiry are thus arranged; from the horoscope questions of length of life are to be sought; from the second in the upward direction, livelihood; from the third, brothers; from the fourth, parents; from the fifth, children; from the sixth, injury or suffering; from the seventh, wife; from the eighth, fortune and death that puts a bound to all, according to the lords of these houses. We, however, seek from the horoscope length of life and peculiarities of soul, from the Sun father, patrimony, leaders, and the senses; from the Moon mother, maternal endowment, and body; from Saturn the confirmation of every written instrument, evil or good, and benefit from inheritances from elders and from the death of outsiders, and crops from the earth; from Jupiter offices, preisthoods, knowledge, children, wealth; from Mars, brothers, and arts of violence carried out by means of fire and iron. Injury comes from Mars, Saturn and the horoscope; by day . . . from Saturn to Mars . . .;;(Col. X);[- - -] . . . [we inquire about] death from the descending sign, and call it the Theme of Death; and in all the book on planetary effects . . . But now we must speak of the phases of the stars or about the Sun's rising and setting . . . And the motion of the planets thus brings about in the case of Mercury and Venus the occasions of their being left behind or running ahead, and in the case of the three remaining planets their stations and retrogressions. Now when the Sun runs 15× away from the stars, the stars rise and exercise especial power upon genitures. Mars is an excessively evil influence at rising until he has escaped from the hostile fire of the Sun. Mercury again overtakes the Sun only after having been left 22× behind him; for as he descends his sphere he comes closer to the earth; but when Venus has been left 48× behind and has stood still, she descends her own proper sphere and overtakes the Sun. Thereafter, being the more depressed, they again precede him by the same distance, and when they have been elevated on their spheres they have their evening stations. Then they are again overtaken by him and within the 15× their concealments take place. The stars are in concord with their effects . . .;;(Col. XI);[- - -] . . . when they stand still they are powerful in their proper effects. But the three stars rising in opposition to the Sun move, preceding the Sun and removed from him by 15×; they come to a standstill when they are 120× away from him and are powerful in their influences; when they are 180× away and are in opposition to him they make their western evening rising and still retreat; then they turn backward in their course and are unfavorable to their own effects; then for the second time they stand still; and at the first [of their station] their significance is good, but at the end evil. Now they await the Sun, and stand still when the sun is 120× distant from them. Then they are concealed and are divergent from their effects. But Mars besides has two other phases, the ninety-day anomalies, when he is in the sextile aspect to the Sun; and in the first he is strongly maleficent and makes evil those who have their nativities at the time; but in the second [he makes] them daring, bold, evildoers and robbers caught in the act; then coming toward him the Sun is in the sexitle aspect to him.;These are called their configurations and phases. There are four configurations of the Sun, two equinoxes in the eighth degree of Aries and of Libra, and two solstices, the summer, in the eighth degree of Cancer, and the winter in the eighth degree of Capricorn. Of the Moon there are preeminently four configurations: conjunction, when it is unseen(?); first half-moon, when it is seven days old; full moon, when it is fourteen; second half-moon when it is twenty-one. The Moon looses the bonds of longitude and latitude in seven-day periods, but the Sun at the solstitial and equinoctial degrees.;The signs, because of the obliquity of the circle, do not ascend in equal periods, but vary in seven different regions or climes. For in the Ethiopic clime Aries ascends in twenty-two periods and Libra in thirty-eight, in which the amount to be added is 2 2/3; in the Syrian clime Aries ascends in twenty-one and Libra in thirty-nine periods, and the amount to be added or subtracted is 3. In the Rhodian clime [Aries ascends] in twenty and Libra in forty periods, and the amount added or subtracted is 3 1/3; in the clime of Asia and Ionia Aries ascends in nineteen and Libra in forty-one, wherein the amount added or subtracted is 3 2/3; in the clime of Argos;;(Col. XII);Aries ascends in eighteeen [and Libra in forty-two, and the amount] added [is 4]; in the clime of Rome and Italy and maritime Gaul Aries ascends [in seventeen and] Libra in forty-three, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 1/3; in . . ., Germany and [Britain] Aries ascends [in sixteen] and Libra in forty-four, and the amount added or subtracted is 4 2/3. Now in every clime Cancer and Capricornus ascend in thirty periods; fifteen periods equal one equinoctial hour, and the period is of primary importance with reference to life.;For the rest, of the signs of the zodiac some hear one another, some see one another, and some perceive one another. Those that hear one another are the ones beginning with the equinoctial signs which are equally distant from them, and their degrees hear each other's degrees and the signs the signs. For since day does not see night because it is diametrically opposite to it, equal night hears equal day. Whenever night is completed in equal hours with the day, the signs also hear one another in periods of time; for the day in Taurus is thirteen hours, when the Sun passes through Pisces or Taurus. Gemini and Aquarius hear each other; for when the Sun is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and when he is in Aquarius the night is fourteen hours. Cancer and Capricornus also are to one another in the relation of hearing, but they are prevented by the Earth intervening between them. Leo and Sagittarius hear one another, and similarly Virgo and Scorpio, but Libra and Aries do not. Equal day looks upon, but does not hear, equal day; so the ten signs beginning with the tropical signs and equally distant on either side look upon one another; as, for instance, Leo and Gemini; for when the Sun is in Leo and similarly when he is in Gemini the day is fourteen hours and the night ten. Similarly Taurus and Virgo look upon one another, then Libra and Aries, then Scorpio and Pisces, then Sagittarius and Aquarius; Capricornus and Cancer, however, have the seeing relation one to another but are thrust apart because of the Earth intervening between them; and no other sign rises where Capricorn rises or where Cancer rises. Thus without seeing each other they rise from these places with no sign looking upon them. For this reason these signs alone cast shadows outside, while the Sun is passing through the signs that look upon one another. Wherefore admittedly day looks upon day. But these signs which perceive one another are the dwelling places of the stars, as Cancer and Leo, Virgo ;;(Col. XIII);[and Gemini, Taurus and Libra, Scorpio and Aries, Pisces and Sagittarius, Capricornus and Aquarius - - -] . . . and the double-bodied, Gemini, Virgo, [Sagittarius, and Pisces . . .] the tropical signs . . . the double-bodied belong to Mercury and Jupiter . . . [- - -] . . . they are called "solid" because of the "solid" signs each one is set aside for a single element . . . [- - -] . . . they are called eccentricities because the earth is the central point of the universe, and is the midmost of the seven planets. Still other ethereal constellations revolve in their own circles. The Sun is in apogee in Gemini; Venus is in perigee in Pisces and in apogee in Virgo; Jupiter is in apogee in Cancer and in perigee in Capricorn . . .;;(Col. XIV-XV: too fragmentary to be translated);;(Col. XVI);[- - -] . . . Hippocrates testified; for he called the Sun Daemon and the Moon Fortune. Leo is a male sign and Cancer female; and to the five gods that move together nature has assigned houses in pairs, a male and a female. For the Sun holds dominion by day, and the Moon by night, and these both by day and by night serve the two kings; and the signs inhabited by them are the vitals of the universe. To Mercury was given the first section, that beneath Leo and Cancer, in which are Virgo and Gemini, female and male. To Venus the zone beneath this, in which are Libra and Taurus, male and female. To Mars the zone beneath this, in which are Scorpio and Aries, female and male. To Jupiter the zone beneath this, in which are Sagittarius and Pisces, male and female. To Saturn the zone over all, Capricornus and Aquarius, female and male. Thus also from these regions they stand guard over the Moon and the Sun. In these signs the stars have their own powers and are vigorous. And nature assigned them thrones and prisons; their thrones the signs upon which they are exalted and have royal power and prisons wherein they are depressed and oppose their own powers. The [throne of the Sun] is at 19× of Aries, [his prison in Libra. The Moon's throne] us 3× of Taurus, [her prison 3× of Scorpio]. Saturn's [throne is 21× of Libra, his prison in Aries. The throne of Jupiter is 15×] of Cancer, his prison 15× [of Capricornus]. The throne of Mars [is 28× of Capricornus and his prison 28] of Cancer. [The throne of] Venus [is 27× of Pisces,] her prison [27× of Virgo].;;(Col. XVII);[- - -] . . . and in Libra, Aquarius and Gemini . . . In Taurus, Virgo, and Capricornus the Moon, Venus and Mercury rejoice, and in part Mars, but he does not take part in the governorship because the trianle belongs to similar gods as masters. In Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer Mars and Venus rejoice, and the Moon shares the triangle as well, but does not take part in the governorship by day. This is the order of the houses and exaltations. . . . [Hermes] observed the stars, among the signs of the zodiac, in the degrees from the first of Leo to the thirtieth of Libra increasing, from 1× of Aquarius to 30× of Aries moving . . . in elevation and latitude, and from 1× of Scorpio to 30× of Capricornus and from 1× of Taurus to 30× of Cancer diminishing, and from equal diminishing quadrants he observed the motion of the universal heavenly bodies becoming . . . He observed that the 360× hold significance for the universe; wherefore the universe is itself imperishable . . . For it moves . . . and equal increment and subtraction . . .;;(Col. XVIII);[- - -] . . . they rejoice in the signs before their own exaltations, and affording complete effects . . . perfect; but they are afflicted in the signs following their own exaltations. For the stars depart from their own exaltations and begin to be depressed; they do not rejoice when they are in opposition tro one another unless they exchange houses. The planets of opposite sects are more harmful when in opposition. The maleficent planets are most prone to injure in the quartile aspect and in opposition, but are harmless in trine. The beneficient planets in trine are most beneficial, in the quartile aspect or in opposition less effective. The triangles that come about when the Sun is in trine with respect to the Moon are sure in their effects but the quartile aspect and opposition are not. . . . [- - -] . . . in the quartile aspect or in opposition to the Moon when it is becoming full signifies insecurity, great and bloody dangers; and in quartile aspect to the waning Moon . . . is especially significant of insecurity and danger . . .;;(Col.
